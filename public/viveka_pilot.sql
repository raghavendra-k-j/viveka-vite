Some benefit plans, such as health insurance and dental insurance, provide for their immediate well being. Other benefit plans promise to provide financial security at retirement. There are a number of ways employers provide retirement benefits for their employees. Most employers will use defined benefit, or pension plans, and/or defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits. The most common type of defined contribution plan is the 401(k) plan.  \\nEmployers have various methods of providing retirement benefits for their employees. Today, more and more employers are asking their employees to share in the responsibility for their retirement. One of the ways employers ask employees to share the cost is through a 401(k) retirement plan. Employees can save for their retirement and also provide an immediate tax savings for themselves and their employer by participating in a 401(k) plan. A 401(k) plan participant decides, within plan limits: how much to contribute, where to invest the contributions, and how long the contributions remain in the plan.  \\nHighly Compensated Employees  \\nUnder ERISA guidelines for plan qualification, a plan may not discriminate in favor of any particular group of employees, such as highly compensated employees (HOEs). Employees are considered highly compensated if:  \\n \\nThey own 5% or more of the company, or  \\nThey have earned $90,000 or more during the previous year (effective for year 2003). For 2004, the amount will remain at $90,000. \\nQualified Plan \\nQualified plans are plans that meet strict IRS requirements. 401(k) plans are a type of qualified plan \\n \\n\\n\\n2.2 Types of Plan \\nOverview \\nEmployers who provide employees with a retirement benefit have a choice whether to use the defined benefit (DB) plan design, commonly called a pension plan or the defined contribution (DC) plan design. For many years the DB plan was the primary method used by employers to provide a retirement benefit. In recent years, employers have turned to a popular DC plan method known as a 401(k) plan. \\nSome employers offer both types of plans while others offer neither. However, most employers elect to offer at least one type of plan to receive the immediate tax & retirement benefit.  \\nDefined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution \\nDefined benefit pension plans and defined contribution savings plans are both designed to provide the employee with retirement income. Some of the common differences between the DB and DC plans are listed in the following chart.  \\n\\t \\tDefined Benefit Plan \\tDefined Contribution Plan \\nThe employer funds it. \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\tEmployee and employer contributions are allocated to individual participants. The participant may have to contribute to receive a benefit. \\nThe employer bears the investment risk. \\t \\t \\t \\tThe participant bears the investment risk. \\nIt is generally difficult to communicate.  \\t \\t \\t \\tIt is easier to communicate.  \\nThere is a definite benefit formula. \\t \\t \\t \\tThe final retirement benefit is unknown. \\nThe benefit is expressed as an annuity  payable at normal retirement age, usually  age 65.  \\t \\tThe benefit is expressed as an account balance. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nThe following plans are designated as defined contribution plans:  \\n401(k) plans \\nProfit sharing plans  \\nThrift plans  \\n403(b) and 457 plans  \\nEmployee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)  \\n \\nThe 401(k) plan is the most popular form of defined contribution plan used by employers today.  \\n \\n2.3 Eligibility  \\nOverview \\nWhen an employer decides to offer a 401(k) plan, it must determine, within ERISA guidelines who will be permitted to participate and how eligibility will be defined. Although ERISA dictates many of the parameters plans must follow it also gives employers some choices when setting eligibility requirements for 401(k) plan participation  \\nEmployers may choose to limit eligibility based on:  \\nAge:  Under ERISA, a plan may limit participation to employees age 21 and over. Plans may choose to allow participation before age 21. \\nService: The maximum service requirement a 401(k) plan can impose for eligibility to participate, by law, is one year. A plan may choose to impose a service requirement as a cost savings measure, especially in industries where there is high turnover in the first year of employment.  \\nNote: DC plans other than 401(k) plans may require two years of service for             eligibility; however, employees entering the plan after two years must be 100% vested immediately upon entering the plan.      \\nEmployment classification:  Employers may choose to only allow full-time and/or permanent employees to participate, thereby excluding part-time and/or temporary employees. \\nNo eligibility requirements: Some plans may choose to have no eligibility restrictions. In this case, all employees would have the option to begin participating immediately upon hire.  \\nService:  If an employer chooses to impose a service requirement, the plan must decide how it will calculate one year of service. ERISA allows a number of methods for calculating when one year of service has been completed including:  \\n \\n \\n                                                    \\n                                                    \\n2\\n \\nC3    -Protected \\t \\tPage 2 of 169 \\nUn-controlled when printed \\n \\n\\n1,000 Hours Method \\tElapsed Time Method \\nThe most common method is to determine if the employee has completed at least 1,000 hours of service in the 12-month period following the date of hire. \\tThis option does not count hours, only the specific length of service, such as one year from the date of hire. \\n\\n \\nEntry Dates \\nERISA allows employers to establish specific times of the year when employees can enroll in 401(k) plans. These are called entry dates. The designated enrollment dates may be quarterly, monthly, or by payroll cycle. Entry dates relieve plans from the possible administrative task of enrolling new participants on a daily basis.  \\nERISA requires that the use of entry dates may not delay entry into the plan by more than six months after the employee has met the plan‟s eligibility requirements. \\n \\n2.4 Contribution \\n401(k) plans offer employers opportunities for flexible plan design within the requirements established by (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and the Department of Labor (DOL).  401 (k) plans may be offered in several different ways with several different contribution options. Some 401(k) plans have employee contributions only and others have both employee and employer contributions. 401(k) plans may have only before-tax contributions or they may have both before- and after-tax contributions.  \\nEmployee Contributions \\nInternal Revenue Code section 401 (a) (17) limits the annual amount of pay a qualified plan may consider in calculating tax-deferred contributions or benefits. This is known as the Maximum Compensation Limit, which limits the amount of pay that is eligible for all contributions. The limit for 2004 is $205,000.  \\nThis means that an employee who earns over this amount annually will be recognized as only earning $205,000 for 401(k) plan purposes. The limit is periodically adjusted by the IRS to reflect changes in the cost of living index. \\nEmployee Before-Tax Contributions \\nDeductions taken from the employee‟s paycheck on a before-tax basis are applied before taxes are taken out of the employee‟s gross income. Only Social Security and Medicare taxes are deducted prior to any before-tax contributions. Before-tax contributions reduce the participant‟s current taxable income. Before-tax contributions are also commonly referred to as pre-tax. \\nEmployee After - Tax Contributions \\nDeductions taken from the employee‟s paycheck on an after-tax basis are applied after all taxes have been taken out of the employee‟s gross income. After-tax contributions are also commonly referred to as post-tax. \\n \\nEmployer Contributions  \\nIn addition to employees making contributions, some employers make contributions on behalf of the employees. Employers may choose to provide these contributions to encourage employee participation in the 401(k) plan and/or attract and retain skilled employees. Employer contributions are considered before-tax contributions and remain tax deferred until withdrawn. Some employers may choose to provide: \\nA matching contribution based on the contributions the participant makes ;  \\nContributions based on the annual profits of the company; \\nBoth types of employer contributions; and  Neither type of employer contributions. \\nEmployer Matching Contributions  \\nMatching contributions are usually a percentage of the participant‟s compensation and are tied to the amount the participant contributes.  \\nEmployers frequently place a limit on the amount of the match. Only employees who have chosen to contribute to the 401(k) plan receive matching contributions.  \\nEmployer Discretionary Contributions \\nDiscretionary contributions can be provided in addition to, or instead of, employer matching contributions. One example of a discretionary contribution is a profit sharing contribution. \\nDiscretionary contributions may change each year and are generally tied to annual profits. \\n\\tEmployers \\tmay \\toffer \\tdiscretionary \\tcontributions \\tone \\tyear \\tand \\tnone \\tthe \\tnext. \\nDiscretionary contributions are made on behalf of all eligible employees even if they choose not to contribute to the 401(k) plan \\n \\n \\n \\n2.5 Vesting \\n\\t2.5.1 \\tOverview  \\nVesting refers to the ownership in all or a portion of the company’s matching contributions or discretionary contributions and the earnings on these contributions. A participant is always 100% vested in employee and rollover contributions and the earnings on those contributions. Employer contributions such as matching or discretionary contributions may be subject to a vesting schedule. \\n\\t2.5.2 \\tVesting Credit  \\nA participant gains ownership of employer contributions and the earnings associated with those contributions according to a schedule referred to as Vesting Schedule, Under ERISA, an employer generally must give credit for a year of vesting for any year in which the employee worked 1,000 hours or more. \\nEmployers may also determine vesting based on elapsed time. Elapsed time does not count hours. An employee receives vesting credit after completing a specific length of service.  \\nERISA provides minimum standards for two types of vesting schedules: cliff and graded. \\nHowever, 401(k) plans may choose to be more generous than the ERISA requirements.  \\nCliff Vesting Schedule \\nIn a cliff vesting schedule, the participant becomes fully vested in the employer contributions and associated earnings after a certain period of time. No partial vesting occurs. For employer contributions for plan years beginning n 2002, a participant must be fully vested after completing three years of vesting service. \\n \\nERISA MINIMUM - CLIFF SCHEDULE \\nYears of Service  \\tVesting %  \\nLess than 3 years  \\t0%  \\n3 years or more  \\t100%  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nGraded Vesting Schedule  \\nIn a graded vesting schedule, the participant becomes vested in the employer contributions and associated earnings gradually over a period of time. For plan years beginning in 2002, ERISA requires that a participant must be fully vested after six years of vesting service. The participant must be at least 20% vested after two years, 40% after three years, 60% after four years, 80% vested after five years of vesting service, and 100% after six years of vesting service.  \\nA plan may be more generous and offer a two-year cliff, for example. \\n\\nERISA MINIMUM - GRADED SCHEDULE  \\nYears of Service  \\tVesting %  \\nLess than 2 years  \\t0%  \\n2 years  \\t20%  \\n3 years  \\t40%  \\n4 years  \\t60%  \\n5 years  \\t80%  \\n6 years  \\t100%  \\n\\n \\nA plan may be more generous and offer a four-year graded schedule, for example, where the participant is fully vested after four years of vesting service. \\n \\n \\n2.6 Forfeitures \\nIf a participant leaves the company before being fully vested, the participant may forfeit all or a portion of the employer contributions and associated earnings. The Exclusive Benefit Rule states that forfeited amounts cannot be returned to the employer, but must be used for the plan‟s participants. The employer can either apply these forfeited amounts to reduce future employer contributions or reallocate forfeitures among the remaining plan participants.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.7 Account Activity  \\nPlan representatives and administrators have the ability to routinely process transactions for participants. They have access to each participant‟s account information to process requisitions to:  \\nChange contribution rates;  \\nChange future investment directions;  \\nMove existing balances from one fund to another; and   Respond to information requests.  \\nThese transactions are processed based on the plan‟s valuation cycle. Participants generally complete these types of transactions through an automated touch-tone phone system or a web site and then receive a confirmation statement. Participants may also contact a plan representative to assist them with the transaction.  \\nContribution Rate Changes  \\nWhen participants first enroll in a 401(k) plan, they must elect the amount they want to contribute to the plan. This amount is expressed as a percentage of eligible compensation. If the 40 1(k) plan permits before-tax and after-tax contributions, the participant elects how much will be contributed on a before-tax and/or after-tax basis.  \\nAfter the initial enrollment, participants may wish to change the percentage of compensation they contribute throughout the year. The plan may, however, limit the number of times a participant can make a change in any plan year. Contribution rate changes are typically processed. Only one or two times per month-usually based on the participant‟s payroll cycle.  \\nChanges cannot exceed plan limits. For example, a 401(k) plan may permit a NHCE participant to contribute between 1% and 15% of eligible compensation. The plan may restrict HCE participants to contribution elections between 1% and 8% of eligible compensation.  \\nInvestment Direction  \\nAn investment direction election determines where future contributions and loan repayments should be invested. Investment directions generally must be made in increments of 1% and must total 100%. A participant‟s investment strategy may change or the participant may want to respond to market changes, and therefore, redirect where the contributions are invested. The investment direction election has no effect on existing balances in the investment funds. \\nFund Transfers \\nFund transfers move balances directly from one investment fund to another investment fund to another investment fund or funds. The participant determines the percentages to be transferred. Participants may make this election through the automated touch-tone system, web site or plan representative.  \\nFund Reallocations  \\nFund reallocations (sometimes called balance reallocations) require the participant to indicate, in whole percentages, an amount for each of the investment choices. The participant may elect a zero percentage for some of the funds. Theoretically, it is as though the participant takes all the money in all the funds and holds it in her hands. She then has to decide, in whole percentages, where the money is to be invested. The total must equal 100%.  \\n2.8 Loans \\n Overview  \\nIf the plan has a loan provision, participants may borrow money from their 401(k) plan account. A plan loan is an agreement that allows participants to borrow from their account and repay the principal, with interest, back into the account, generally repaid through payroll deductions. If the loan is repaid on schedule, no tax liability is incurred; however, failure to repay will result in default of the loan and tax consequences to the participant.\\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) & Internal Revenue Service (IRS) imposes several plan loan restrictions to ensure that loan provisions are designed in a nondiscriminatory manner with regard to: \\nAvailability; \\nInterest rates; \\nThe security of the loan and  Administrative procedures.  \\nLoan amounts;  \\nThe duration of the loan; and  Taxes. \\nAlthough 401(k) plans are not required to offer loans, an employer may choose to offer one or both of the following loan: \\nGeneral purpose loan (also referred to as a general loan) \\nHome loan (also referred to as a primary residence loan)  \\nERISA imposes restrictions on the maximum duration of a loan. Typically, a general purpose loan must be repaid within 5 years. A home loan may be extended beyond the five years period (that is, 5, 10, 15 or 20 years or other period). If participant is refinancing a home loan, the new loan will need to be paid off within the original term of the loan.   \\n \\nThe IRS restricts maximum loan amounts. If the plan permits, a participant may have more than one loan outstanding. However, the maximum amount a participant may borrow at any one time is $50,000 of his vested account balance (VAB). Under ERISA, the VAB includes outstanding loan balances (OLBs).  \\n \\nThe amount a participant may borrow is determined by using the following formula:  \\nThe lesser of:  \\n1/2 (Vested Account Balance + Outstanding Loan Balance)-Outstanding Loan Balance  or  \\n$50,000 minus the highest Outstanding Loan Balance in the past 12 months  (The highest OLB can come from loans currently outstanding or loans that were  paid in full during the past 12 months.)  \\n \\nFor example, if a plan sets a minimum loan amount of $1 000, the participant‟s vested account balance must be at least $2000 with no outstanding loans. \\n \\nThe plan may restrict a particular type of contribution (for example, employer match) from being borrowed, yet allow those contributions to be included in the account balance recognized in the maximum loan amount calculation.  \\nThe amount available for a participant to borrow is based on the vested value of the account on the day he requests for the loan, since the loan is actually paid from the participant‟s account on the date it is processed. It is likely that the participant‟s vested account balance has changed. However, it is important to note that the 50% rule pertains to the vested account balance at the time of the request, not at the time the loan is processed. \\nLoan money comes from the before-tax money type, which includes:  \\nEmployee before-tax contributions;  \\nEmployer match;  \\nPrevious rollover monies; and  \\nThe earnings from these monies.  \\nIn some cases, after-tax contributions are also included. The plan determines the order of the money types used to provide loan. For example, some plans may require loan amounts to come from rollover money first, then employee before-tax contributions, then employer contributions, and last employee after-tax contributions. \\nLoan Repayments \\nParticipants must repay loans according to the terms agreed to under the plan, but no less frequently than quarterly. Generally, loan repayments are made through payroll deductions each pay period with after tax dollars. Exceptions may occur, however. A participant can be on unpaid leave, for example, and make payments from a personal check or electronic fund transfer, if the plan allows. An amortization schedule shows how the portion of each repayment applies to the outstanding interest and principal. \\nThe money is usually repaid according to the current investment direction elected by the participant and is repaid to its original money type even though it is deducted from the participants paycheck after taxes are taken out. Therefore the investment funds the loan is paid from will often not be the same investment funds to which repayment is made. However the repayment is made into the contribution type the loan money was taken from. \\nLoan Prepayments  \\nPrepayment of loans, in full, is generally permitted at any time. Some plans may permit partial prepayment. Procedure for prepayment varies from plan to plan. \\nDeemed Distribution \\nMost loans are repaid by deductions from the employee‟s paycheck. Generally, when a participant with an outstanding loan goes on unpaid leave, the loan can be repaid manually by check or electronic fund transfer. If an active participant does not make the required payments, the loan will be considered a deemed distribution after a fixed period of time, usually 90 days.  \\nParticipants who have a deemed distribution will receive an IRS Form 1099-R in January of the year following the year in which the deemed distribution occurred. Deemed distributions are not eligible for rollover to a qualified plan or IRA. \\nIf a participant has a loan that is considered to be a deemed distribution, and the loan has not been repaid, he will generally not be allowed to request a new loan until the deemed loan is paid back. As of January 1, 2004, some plans may allow their participants with an unpaid loan considered as a deemed distribution to request a new loan if the participant enters into a payroll withholding agreement or provides the plan with adequate security for the loan. This policy may not apply to all our clients‟ plans. In other words, this policy may vary from client to client. \\nSuspension of loan repayments during an active military leave of absence will NOT cause the loan to be deemed distributed, even if the leave exceeds a year. The loan must be fully repaid by the end of the original term plus the period of the active military service. .  \\nSeparating from Service with an Outstanding Loan Balance \\nIf the participant separates from service with an outstanding loan balance, most employers require that the loan be repaid, in full, within a specified period of time after separation. If the loan is not repaid within the specified time, it is defaulted and reported as a taxable distribution for the year in which it is defaulted. \\nTaxation of Defaulted Loans \\nFailure to repay a loan after separating from service, according to the terms of the plan results in default of the loan. If the loan is defaulted, the outstanding loan balance is considered a taxable distribution and is thus subject to federal (and state, if applicable) income tax withholding for the year of the distribution. The participant receives an IRS Form 1099-R for the outstanding loan balance in January following the year of default. If the participant defaults on the loan after separating from service, the outstanding loan balance is reported as taxable income. \\n \\n \\n2.9 Withdrawal \\nAlthough the primary purpose of a 401(k) plan is to help employees save for retirement, many plans allow participants to withdraw money from their 401(k) plan (MS accounts while actively employed. Employers are not required to make withdrawals from 401(k) plans available to their participants. Therefore, the plans of different employers are structured differently, with some being more restrictive in their withdrawal provisions than others. If in-service withdrawals are permitted from the plan, the money withdrawn from the account cannot be paid back and is subject to taxation if not rolled over. \\nActively employed participants can make these three main types of withdrawals from their plan accounts: \\n Regular or ordinary withdrawal;   Hardship withdrawal; and   Age 59½ withdrawal.  \\nEach type of withdrawal has specific Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and plan restrictions controlling the money types available for withdrawal and the order of their withdrawal. \\n \\n\\t2.9.1 \\tTaxation of In-Service Withdrawals \\nUnder current federal tax law, participants are not required to pay federal, and in most cases, state and local income tax on contributions and their earnings in a 401(k) plan as long as they remain in the plan. Generally, whenever money is withdrawn or distributed from a 401(k) plan it becomes subject to taxation. Taxation varies depending on the money type withdrawn and the reason for the withdrawal in general \\nThe withdrawal is subject to a 20% mandatory federal income tax withholding, if not rolled over. The amount of the mandatory withholding may be more or less than the amount the participant owes in federal income tax. A participants actual tax liability for the withdrawal will depend on the participants own tax situation for example exemptions household income deductions etc Withholding for state taxes may also be required. \\n \\nAmounts obtained from in-service withdrawals may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if the participant is under age 59 ½. The plan does not withhold for the 10% penalty tax at the time of distribution; participants pay the penalty when they file their taxes.  \\n \\nAn IRS Form 1099-R is mailed to the participant in January of the year following the year in which the withdrawal is taken. For example, for a withdrawal taken in March of 2003, the participant receives a 1099-R in January 2004. This form shows the total amount of the withdrawal, the amount subject to tax, and the amount of federal and state tax withheld and forwarded to the IRS and state agencies. \\n \\n\\t2.9.2 \\tRegular Withdrawal  \\n Overview \\nA regular or ordinary withdrawal has the same basic characteristics of all in- service withdrawals: \\nThey are generally available only to actively employed participants;  \\nThe plan sponsor chooses the money or contribution types available; and establishes a withdrawal hierarchy.  \\n Contribution Types Available \\nThe types of contributions and associated earnings available for a regular withdrawal are chosen by the plan sponsor and may include:  \\nAfter-tax;  \\nRollover; and \\nEmployer contributions.  \\nRegular withdrawals do not include participant before-tax contributions or the associated earnings. ESOP, PAYSOP and TRASOP money is usually available for in-service withdrawals. \\n \\n \\n\\t2.9.3 \\tHardship Withdrawal \\nOverview  \\nParticipants with immediate and heavy financial need and no reasonable access to money from elsewhere can withdraw certain contributions from their 401(k) plans. The plan administrator determines whether the participant fulfills Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and plan-imposed hardship withdrawal requirements. He reviews the withdrawal request and associated documents and makes the determination based either on the “facts and circumstances” of each case or adoption of the Internal Revenue Code “safe harbor” guidelines or a combination of both.  \\nIRS Requirements \\nIRS regulations provide a narrow definition of hardship: The hardship must be caused by the immediate and heavy financial needs of the participant for which other resources are not reasonably available.  \\nTo qualify for a hardship withdrawal, the participant‟s request must pass a two-part test.  \\nthe qualifying need exists; and.  \\nno other resources are reasonably available to meet the need.  \\n       To determine the “existence of need” employers may use one of two methods:  \\nlRS Safe Harbors \\nFacts and Circumstances  \\n \\n\\t2.9.4 \\tAge 59 ½ Withdrawal \\nOverview  \\nActive participants age 59 ½ and older may take in-service withdrawals from their 401(k) plans. At age 59 ½, 401(k) plan participants may have access to more of their account. \\nContribution Types Available \\nIf the 401(k) plan allows, the participant may withdraw vested amounts from all types of contributions within individual plan limits. All participant contributions and associated earnings, including before tax monies, are made available for withdrawal at age 59 ½ Depending on plan provisions, employer contributions may be restricted. \\n \\n \\n2.10 Rollover \\nIn-Bound Rollovers  \\nEmployees may also contribute to a 401(k) plan by rolling over contributions. In-bound rollovers from another qualified plan or conduit IRA. Employees who have contributions in another qualified plan, usually from another employer, may be allowed to roll over these contributions to the current employer‟s plan to continue deferring the contributions from taxes. Beginning with plan years after December 31, 2001, taxable money in an IRA can be rolled to a 401(k) plan without using a conduit IRA.  \\n \\nIn-bound rollovers into a qualified plan may only contain taxable contributions and earnings. Beginning in 2002, after-tax contributions can be rolled over. Prior to 2002, after-tax contributions could not be rolled over, though the earnings on after-tax contributions were eligible for rollover since they had never been taxed. If a qualified plan accepts rollover of after-tax contributions, it must agree to account for the after-tax contributions separately.  \\n \\n \\n In-Bound Rollover Procedures  \\nThere are no regulations stating that employers must accept in-bound rollover contributions into their qualified plans. As a result, employers may or may not allow in-bound rollovers. Plans are required, however, to offer rollovers-out to other plans.  \\nIf rollovers-in are permitted in the plan, the following general procedures may apply: \\nEmployers may require employees to be able to participate in the 401(k) plan before rollovers-in will be accepted.  \\nEmployees may need to complete an in-bound rollover-in request form. The form will ask for the desired investment direction for the amount rolled over. \\nEmployees must attach the check from the previous plan or IRA.  \\nEmployees may need to provide documentation verifying that the in-bound rollover came from a qualified plan or a conduit IRA. Examples of this documentation include: letter of determination or a distribution statement.  \\n \\nOut - Bound Rollovers  \\nAt the time of distribution, the participant has the option to continue to defer taxation by rolling over all or a portion of the eligible account balance into an Individual Retirement Account or another qualified plan A direct rollover allows the participant to move the eligible account balance directly from one qualified plan to another or to an IRA Eligible account balances rolled into an IRA can subsequently be rolled into a qualified plan if it has been held in a conduit IRA (def An IRA that contains only taxable money from a qualified employer retirement plan It is not commingled with other money). \\n \\nBeginning in 2002 taxable money in an IRA can be rolled to a 401(k) plan without being held in a conduit IRA .Amounts that are eligible to be rolled over include employee before tax contributions and earnings, employer contributions and earnings, rollovers and associated earnings and aftertax contributions and associated earnings. Because of EGTRRA, after tax contributions are now eligible for a rollover. If the entire eligible account balance is rolled over, there are no tax consequences. The account balance is simply moving from one tax-deferred vehicle to another. \\n \\nIf at the time of distribution, participants elect to have their account balance paid directly to them, 20% of the taxable distribution will be withheld for federal income tax withholding. Withholding for state taxes may be required. A rollover option still exists however. Participants may choose to open their own IRA or make a rollover contribution to their new employer‟s qualified plan within60 days of the distribution. Participants may add their own money to make up all or a portion of the entire 20% that was withheld.  \\n \\nThe withholding tax paid to the IRS will be combined with all other taxes paid by the participant for the year. Participants may be due a refund when they file their tax return at year-end. \\n \\n \\n2.11 Distribution \\n Overview  \\nShareholders may take final distributions, upon termination, from a stock fund in the form of shares or cash. In certain types of plans, the employer may be required to offer the distribution in the form of shares Upon distribution it is up to the participant to decide whether to take the shares or receive the value of the shares as cash instead. When a participant chooses a share distribution, fractional shares in a participant‟s account are paid in cash. \\nFor example, a participant elects to take a distribution in shares. At the time of the distribution, she has a dollar value in her account of $1,520. The shares are valued at $50 a share. She would receive 30 shares of stock (30 X $50 = $1,500) and $20 in cash. \\n Participants qualify for final distribution of their vested account balances when they: \\nSeparate from service (retirement or otherwise);  \\nQualify as disabled under the specific plan guidelines;  \\nDie, in which case the account balance can be distributed to their designated beneficiary. \\nFinal distributions can be paid in several ways. Some forms of payment are required while others are not. Forms of payment include:  \\nA lump sum payment;  \\nDeferred payment; \\nInstallments; and \\nAn annuity, although these are rare.  \\nWhen a participant dies, the beneficiary is entitled to payment of the account balance. If the participant is married at the time of death, the beneficiary would automatically be the spouse. If the spouse has signed a valid consent/waiver, the participant may name someone else as beneficiary to receive amounts in the 401(k) plan after the participant‟s death. Spousal beneficiaries have the option to defer distribution until the participant would have been 70Y2. Non-spousal beneficiaries must receive a distribution no later than five years after the participant‟s death. The employer decides which payment options, besides those legally required, are offered by the plan. \\n\\t2.11.1 \\tFinal Distribution Requirements \\nWhen a participant retires, leaves the company, or becomes disabled the participant can elect to: \\nReceive a distribution, or \\nLeave the money in the plan until a later date (defer the payment)  provided the vested account balance is greater than the plan‟s cash out  level (see below). \\nIf the participant leaves the account balance in the plan:  \\nTaxes will continue to be deferred until the participant receives the  money.  \\nThe balance of the account that remains in the plan will share in gains  or losses of the investment funds.  \\nInvestment changes may be made according to the rules of the  individual plan.  \\nThe participant can request a final distribution at any time in the future.  \\nThe forms of payment for final distribution must include a lump sum payment option; however, the plan sponsor does have some discretion. For example, the plan sponsor may or may not offer installment and/or annuity payments.  \\n \\nCash out Amounts \\nWhen participants request a final distribution, they receive a distribution package, which explains payment options as well as the rollover option. For administrative convenience, ERISA permits 401(k) plan balances at or below a certain level, referred to as the cash out amount, to be paid out after separation from service of employment without the participant‟s consent. The current threshold is a vested account balance of $5,000 or less. Plan sponsors have the choice to implement this option.  \\nIf the vested account balance is greater than $5,000, IRC regulations require the participant‟s consent before making a lump sum distribution. Without the participant‟s consent, the distribution will be deferred.  \\nIf the vested account balance is $5,000 or less, then the lump sum payment may be distributed without the participant‟s consent. The participant must be given an opportunity to elect a direct rollover of the eligible account balance.  \\nPayment Options  \\nIf participants choose to receive a distribution from the plan, they may be able to choose from various payment options, which may include:  \\nLump sum paid to the participant - the participant‟s vested account balance is distributed to the participant. The plan administrator automatically deducts the mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding from the distribution. The distribution may also be subject to the 10% penalty tax if the participant is under the age of 59 ½ and not otherwise exempt. Withholding for state taxes may also be required. \\n \\nLump sum rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA - the participant‟s vested account balance is distributed to the qualified plan or IRA. There is no federal income tax withholding. \\nInstallment - a specific number of payments of approximately equal value. The payment amount is calculated based on the number of payments requested. An example of an installment payment option would be a provision, which allows participants to elect up to 20 annual installments. Installment payments of ten years or less are eligible to be rolled over.  \\nAnnuity - a series of regular payments, guaranteed to continue for a specific time, usually the participant‟s lifetime. The payment amount is calculated based on the life expectancy of the participant or the participant and the joint beneficiary (using IRS actuarial tables). Annuities are rare in 401(k) plans.  \\n \\nIf the participant defers payment, the participant may come back at any time and request a distribution. The ability of a participant to leave money in the 401(k) plan account depends on whether it is above the cash out level ($5,000). If the balance of the account is above the cash out level, a participant cannot be forced to take a distribution. Ievel, a participant cannot be forced to take a distribution.  \\n Taxation of Final Distributions \\nAs with withdrawals, final distributions are subject to the mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding, and the 10% penalty tax if the participant is under age 59¼ and not otherwise exempt, unless the distribution is directly rolled over Withholding of state taxes may also be required.  \\nThe 10% penalty tax does not apply if the final distribution is made \\nAfter age 59 ½;  \\nBecause of separation from service at or after age 55 (separation includes leaving the company for any reason or retirement);  \\nPayable in the form of periodic payment;  \\nOn account of a QDRO; or \\nFor certain medical expenses (those that are deductible for income tax purpose; unreimbursed medical expenses must exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. \\n\\t2.11.2 \\tMinimum Required Distribution  \\nOverview  \\nAge 70 ½ minimum required distributions, more commonly known as, Minimum Required Distributions (MRDs), mandate certain 401(k) plan participants receive certain minimum payment from their account balances beginning at age 70 ½. MRDs apply to all qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans and pension plans. MRDs also apply to IRAs. \\nRequirements \\nThe IRC requires participants to begin receiving MRDs from a 401(k) plan no later than April 1 following the year in which the participant reaches age 70 ½. \\nMRDs are paid annually. The first payment must begin by April 1 of the year following the year in which the participant turns 70 ½ Subsequent distributions must be paid by December 31 of each year. Consequently, there may be two payments received in the first year.  \\nIf the participant fails to receive an annual minimum required distribution during the required time frame, the individual may incur a tax penalty equal to 50% of the amount that should have been distributed.  \\nBeginning in 1997, active participants in 401(k) plans who are over age 70 ½ can delay commencement of MRDs until the later of retirement or separation from service. \\nNote, this does not apply to IRA participants or 401(k) plan participants who own 5% or more of the company. The IRS requires them to begin receiving MRDs at age 70 ½.  \\nThe MRD calculation is based on the participant‟s life expectancy, or the joint life expectancies of the participant and designated beneficiary based on actuarial tables set forth by the IRS. \\n Taxation of 70 ½ Minimum Required Distributions \\nThe mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding does not apply to MRDs. Instead, the recipient is required to make a federal income tax withholding election on IRS Form W-4P. In some cases, if the participant fails to make a withholding election before the annual payment is made, the plan withholds federal income tax based on a default election. An MRD is not eligible for rollover. Participants can no longer defer paying taxes on this money once the MRD has been paid to them. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\"}]}', NULL, '{\"plan_text_in_markdown_format\":\"- Single Correct Questions: 3 questions, all DIFFICULT level\\n- Multiple Correct Questions: 2 questions, all DIFFICULT level\",\"assessment_title\":\"Retirement and Financial Services Examination\",\"assessment_description\":\"This assessment evaluates your understanding of retirement and financial services, focusing on complex scenarios and decision-making processes related to retirement plans.\",\"single_correct_questions\":[{\"number\":\"1/5\",\"question\":\"What is the primary investment risk difference between Defined Benefit (DB) and Defined Contribution (DC) plans?\",\"choices\":[\"Employer bears the risk in DB, employee bears the risk in DC\",\"Employer and employee share the risk equally in both\",\"Employee bears the risk in DB, employer bears the risk in DC\",\"No investment risk in either plan\"],\"correct_answer_text\":\"Employer bears the risk in DB, employee bears the risk in DC\",\"explanation\":\"In Defined Benefit plans, the employer is responsible for providing the specified retirement benefit and bears the investment risk.

Some benefit plans, such as health insurance and dental insurance, provide for their immediate well being. Other benefit plans promise to provide financial security at retirement. There are a number of ways employers provide retirement benefits for their employees. Most employers will use defined benefit, or pension plans, and/or defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits. The most common type of defined contribution plan is the 401(k) plan.  \\nEmployers have various methods of providing retirement benefits for their employees. Today, more and more employers are asking their employees to share in the responsibility for their retirement. One of the ways employers ask employees to share the cost is through a 401(k) retirement plan. Employees can save for their retirement and also provide an immediate tax savings for themselves and their employer by participating in a 401(k) plan. A 401(k) plan participant decides, within plan limits: how much to contribute, where to invest the contributions, and how long the contributions remain in the plan.  \\nHighly Compensated Employees  \\nUnder ERISA guidelines for plan qualification, a plan may not discriminate in favor of any particular group of employees, such as highly compensated employees (HOEs). Employees are considered highly compensated if:  \\n \\nThey own 5% or more of the company, or  \\nThey have earned $90,000 or more during the previous year (effective for year 2003). For 2004, the amount will remain at $90,000. \\nQualified Plan \\nQualified plans are plans that meet strict IRS requirements. 401(k) plans are a type of qualified plan \\n \\n\\n\\n2.2 Types of Plan \\nOverview \\nEmployers who provide employees with a retirement benefit have a choice whether to use the defined benefit (DB) plan design, commonly called a pension plan or the defined contribution (DC) plan design. For many years the DB plan was the primary method used by employers to provide a retirement benefit. In recent years, employers have turned to a popular DC plan method known as a 401(k) plan. \\nSome employers offer both types of plans while others offer neither. However, most employers elect to offer at least one type of plan to receive the immediate tax & retirement benefit.  \\nDefined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution \\nDefined benefit pension plans and defined contribution savings plans are both designed to provide the employee with retirement income. Some of the common differences between the DB and DC plans are listed in the following chart.  \\n\\t \\tDefined Benefit Plan \\tDefined Contribution Plan \\nThe employer funds it. \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\tEmployee and employer contributions are allocated to individual participants. The participant may have to contribute to receive a benefit. \\nThe employer bears the investment risk. \\t \\t \\t \\tThe participant bears the investment risk. \\nIt is generally difficult to communicate.  \\t \\t \\t \\tIt is easier to communicate.  \\nThere is a definite benefit formula. \\t \\t \\t \\tThe final retirement benefit is unknown. \\nThe benefit is expressed as an annuity  payable at normal retirement age, usually  age 65.  \\t \\tThe benefit is expressed as an account balance. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nThe following plans are designated as defined contribution plans:  \\n401(k) plans \\nProfit sharing plans  \\nThrift plans  \\n403(b) and 457 plans  \\nEmployee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)  \\n \\nThe 401(k) plan is the most popular form of defined contribution plan used by employers today.  \\n \\n2.3 Eligibility  \\nOverview \\nWhen an employer decides to offer a 401(k) plan, it must determine, within ERISA guidelines who will be permitted to participate and how eligibility will be defined. Although ERISA dictates many of the parameters plans must follow it also gives employers some choices when setting eligibility requirements for 401(k) plan participation  \\nEmployers may choose to limit eligibility based on:  \\nAge:  Under ERISA, a plan may limit participation to employees age 21 and over. Plans may choose to allow participation before age 21. \\nService: The maximum service requirement a 401(k) plan can impose for eligibility to participate, by law, is one year. A plan may choose to impose a service requirement as a cost savings measure, especially in industries where there is high turnover in the first year of employment.  \\nNote: DC plans other than 401(k) plans may require two years of service for             eligibility; however, employees entering the plan after two years must be 100% vested immediately upon entering the plan.      \\nEmployment classification:  Employers may choose to only allow full-time and/or permanent employees to participate, thereby excluding part-time and/or temporary employees. \\nNo eligibility requirements: Some plans may choose to have no eligibility restrictions. In this case, all employees would have the option to begin participating immediately upon hire.  \\nService:  If an employer chooses to impose a service requirement, the plan must decide how it will calculate one year of service. ERISA allows a number of methods for calculating when one year of service has been completed including:  \\n \\n \\n                                                    \\n                                                    \\n2\\n \\nC3    -Protected \\t \\tPage 2 of 169 \\nUn-controlled when printed \\n \\n\\n1,000 Hours Method \\tElapsed Time Method \\nThe most common method is to determine if the employee has completed at least 1,000 hours of service in the 12-month period following the date of hire. \\tThis option does not count hours, only the specific length of service, such as one year from the date of hire. \\n\\n \\nEntry Dates \\nERISA allows employers to establish specific times of the year when employees can enroll in 401(k) plans. These are called entry dates. The designated enrollment dates may be quarterly, monthly, or by payroll cycle. Entry dates relieve plans from the possible administrative task of enrolling new participants on a daily basis.  \\nERISA requires that the use of entry dates may not delay entry into the plan by more than six months after the employee has met the plan‟s eligibility requirements. \\n \\n2.4 Contribution \\n401(k) plans offer employers opportunities for flexible plan design within the requirements established by (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and the Department of Labor (DOL).  401 (k) plans may be offered in several different ways with several different contribution options. Some 401(k) plans have employee contributions only and others have both employee and employer contributions. 401(k) plans may have only before-tax contributions or they may have both before- and after-tax contributions.  \\nEmployee Contributions \\nInternal Revenue Code section 401 (a) (17) limits the annual amount of pay a qualified plan may consider in calculating tax-deferred contributions or benefits. This is known as the Maximum Compensation Limit, which limits the amount of pay that is eligible for all contributions. The limit for 2004 is $205,000.  \\nThis means that an employee who earns over this amount annually will be recognized as only earning $205,000 for 401(k) plan purposes. The limit is periodically adjusted by the IRS to reflect changes in the cost of living index. \\nEmployee Before-Tax Contributions \\nDeductions taken from the employee‟s paycheck on a before-tax basis are applied before taxes are taken out of the employee‟s gross income. Only Social Security and Medicare taxes are deducted prior to any before-tax contributions. Before-tax contributions reduce the participant‟s current taxable income. Before-tax contributions are also commonly referred to as pre-tax. \\nEmployee After - Tax Contributions \\nDeductions taken from the employee‟s paycheck on an after-tax basis are applied after all taxes have been taken out of the employee‟s gross income. After-tax contributions are also commonly referred to as post-tax. \\n \\nEmployer Contributions  \\nIn addition to employees making contributions, some employers make contributions on behalf of the employees. Employers may choose to provide these contributions to encourage employee participation in the 401(k) plan and/or attract and retain skilled employees. Employer contributions are considered before-tax contributions and remain tax deferred until withdrawn. Some employers may choose to provide: \\nA matching contribution based on the contributions the participant makes ;  \\nContributions based on the annual profits of the company; \\nBoth types of employer contributions; and  Neither type of employer contributions. \\nEmployer Matching Contributions  \\nMatching contributions are usually a percentage of the participant‟s compensation and are tied to the amount the participant contributes.  \\nEmployers frequently place a limit on the amount of the match. Only employees who have chosen to contribute to the 401(k) plan receive matching contributions.  \\nEmployer Discretionary Contributions \\nDiscretionary contributions can be provided in addition to, or instead of, employer matching contributions. One example of a discretionary contribution is a profit sharing contribution. \\nDiscretionary contributions may change each year and are generally tied to annual profits. \\n\\tEmployers \\tmay \\toffer \\tdiscretionary \\tcontributions \\tone \\tyear \\tand \\tnone \\tthe \\tnext. \\nDiscretionary contributions are made on behalf of all eligible employees even if they choose not to contribute to the 401(k) plan \\n \\n \\n \\n2.5 Vesting \\n\\t2.5.1 \\tOverview  \\nVesting refers to the ownership in all or a portion of the company’s matching contributions or discretionary contributions and the earnings on these contributions. A participant is always 100% vested in employee and rollover contributions and the earnings on those contributions. Employer contributions such as matching or discretionary contributions may be subject to a vesting schedule. \\n\\t2.5.2 \\tVesting Credit  \\nA participant gains ownership of employer contributions and the earnings associated with those contributions according to a schedule referred to as Vesting Schedule, Under ERISA, an employer generally must give credit for a year of vesting for any year in which the employee worked 1,000 hours or more. \\nEmployers may also determine vesting based on elapsed time. Elapsed time does not count hours. An employee receives vesting credit after completing a specific length of service.  \\nERISA provides minimum standards for two types of vesting schedules: cliff and graded. \\nHowever, 401(k) plans may choose to be more generous than the ERISA requirements.  \\nCliff Vesting Schedule \\nIn a cliff vesting schedule, the participant becomes fully vested in the employer contributions and associated earnings after a certain period of time. No partial vesting occurs. For employer contributions for plan years beginning n 2002, a participant must be fully vested after completing three years of vesting service. \\n \\nERISA MINIMUM - CLIFF SCHEDULE \\nYears of Service  \\tVesting %  \\nLess than 3 years  \\t0%  \\n3 years or more  \\t100%  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nGraded Vesting Schedule  \\nIn a graded vesting schedule, the participant becomes vested in the employer contributions and associated earnings gradually over a period of time. For plan years beginning in 2002, ERISA requires that a participant must be fully vested after six years of vesting service. The participant must be at least 20% vested after two years, 40% after three years, 60% after four years, 80% vested after five years of vesting service, and 100% after six years of vesting service.  \\nA plan may be more generous and offer a two-year cliff, for example. \\n\\nERISA MINIMUM - GRADED SCHEDULE  \\nYears of Service  \\tVesting %  \\nLess than 2 years  \\t0%  \\n2 years  \\t20%  \\n3 years  \\t40%  \\n4 years  \\t60%  \\n5 years  \\t80%  \\n6 years  \\t100%  \\n\\n \\nA plan may be more generous and offer a four-year graded schedule, for example, where the participant is fully vested after four years of vesting service. \\n \\n \\n2.6 Forfeitures \\nIf a participant leaves the company before being fully vested, the participant may forfeit all or a portion of the employer contributions and associated earnings. The Exclusive Benefit Rule states that forfeited amounts cannot be returned to the employer, but must be used for the plan‟s participants. The employer can either apply these forfeited amounts to reduce future employer contributions or reallocate forfeitures among the remaining plan participants.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.7 Account Activity  \\nPlan representatives and administrators have the ability to routinely process transactions for participants. They have access to each participant‟s account information to process requisitions to:  \\nChange contribution rates;  \\nChange future investment directions;  \\nMove existing balances from one fund to another; and   Respond to information requests.  \\nThese transactions are processed based on the plan‟s valuation cycle. Participants generally complete these types of transactions through an automated touch-tone phone system or a web site and then receive a confirmation statement. Participants may also contact a plan representative to assist them with the transaction.  \\nContribution Rate Changes  \\nWhen participants first enroll in a 401(k) plan, they must elect the amount they want to contribute to the plan. This amount is expressed as a percentage of eligible compensation. If the 40 1(k) plan permits before-tax and after-tax contributions, the participant elects how much will be contributed on a before-tax and/or after-tax basis.  \\nAfter the initial enrollment, participants may wish to change the percentage of compensation they contribute throughout the year. The plan may, however, limit the number of times a participant can make a change in any plan year. Contribution rate changes are typically processed. Only one or two times per month-usually based on the participant‟s payroll cycle.  \\nChanges cannot exceed plan limits. For example, a 401(k) plan may permit a NHCE participant to contribute between 1% and 15% of eligible compensation. The plan may restrict HCE participants to contribution elections between 1% and 8% of eligible compensation.  \\nInvestment Direction  \\nAn investment direction election determines where future contributions and loan repayments should be invested. Investment directions generally must be made in increments of 1% and must total 100%. A participant‟s investment strategy may change or the participant may want to respond to market changes, and therefore, redirect where the contributions are invested. The investment direction election has no effect on existing balances in the investment funds. \\nFund Transfers \\nFund transfers move balances directly from one investment fund to another investment fund to another investment fund or funds. The participant determines the percentages to be transferred. Participants may make this election through the automated touch-tone system, web site or plan representative.  \\nFund Reallocations  \\nFund reallocations (sometimes called balance reallocations) require the participant to indicate, in whole percentages, an amount for each of the investment choices. The participant may elect a zero percentage for some of the funds. Theoretically, it is as though the participant takes all the money in all the funds and holds it in her hands. She then has to decide, in whole percentages, where the money is to be invested. The total must equal 100%.  \\n2.8 Loans \\n Overview  \\nIf the plan has a loan provision, participants may borrow money from their 401(k) plan account. A plan loan is an agreement that allows participants to borrow from their account and repay the principal, with interest, back into the account, generally repaid through payroll deductions. If the loan is repaid on schedule, no tax liability is incurred; however, failure to repay will result in default of the loan and tax consequences to the participant.\\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) & Internal Revenue Service (IRS) imposes several plan loan restrictions to ensure that loan provisions are designed in a nondiscriminatory manner with regard to: \\nAvailability; \\nInterest rates; \\nThe security of the loan and  Administrative procedures.  \\nLoan amounts;  \\nThe duration of the loan; and  Taxes. \\nAlthough 401(k) plans are not required to offer loans, an employer may choose to offer one or both of the following loan: \\nGeneral purpose loan (also referred to as a general loan) \\nHome loan (also referred to as a primary residence loan)  \\nERISA imposes restrictions on the maximum duration of a loan. Typically, a general purpose loan must be repaid within 5 years. A home loan may be extended beyond the five years period (that is, 5, 10, 15 or 20 years or other period). If participant is refinancing a home loan, the new loan will need to be paid off within the original term of the loan.   \\n \\nThe IRS restricts maximum loan amounts. If the plan permits, a participant may have more than one loan outstanding. However, the maximum amount a participant may borrow at any one time is $50,000 of his vested account balance (VAB). Under ERISA, the VAB includes outstanding loan balances (OLBs).  \\n \\nThe amount a participant may borrow is determined by using the following formula:  \\nThe lesser of:  \\n1/2 (Vested Account Balance + Outstanding Loan Balance)-Outstanding Loan Balance  or  \\n$50,000 minus the highest Outstanding Loan Balance in the past 12 months  (The highest OLB can come from loans currently outstanding or loans that were  paid in full during the past 12 months.)  \\n \\nFor example, if a plan sets a minimum loan amount of $1 000, the participant‟s vested account balance must be at least $2000 with no outstanding loans. \\n \\nThe plan may restrict a particular type of contribution (for example, employer match) from being borrowed, yet allow those contributions to be included in the account balance recognized in the maximum loan amount calculation.  \\nThe amount available for a participant to borrow is based on the vested value of the account on the day he requests for the loan, since the loan is actually paid from the participant‟s account on the date it is processed. It is likely that the participant‟s vested account balance has changed. However, it is important to note that the 50% rule pertains to the vested account balance at the time of the request, not at the time the loan is processed. \\nLoan money comes from the before-tax money type, which includes:  \\nEmployee before-tax contributions;  \\nEmployer match;  \\nPrevious rollover monies; and  \\nThe earnings from these monies.  \\nIn some cases, after-tax contributions are also included. The plan determines the order of the money types used to provide loan. For example, some plans may require loan amounts to come from rollover money first, then employee before-tax contributions, then employer contributions, and last employee after-tax contributions. \\nLoan Repayments \\nParticipants must repay loans according to the terms agreed to under the plan, but no less frequently than quarterly. Generally, loan repayments are made through payroll deductions each pay period with after tax dollars. Exceptions may occur, however. A participant can be on unpaid leave, for example, and make payments from a personal check or electronic fund transfer, if the plan allows. An amortization schedule shows how the portion of each repayment applies to the outstanding interest and principal. \\nThe money is usually repaid according to the current investment direction elected by the participant and is repaid to its original money type even though it is deducted from the participants paycheck after taxes are taken out. Therefore the investment funds the loan is paid from will often not be the same investment funds to which repayment is made. However the repayment is made into the contribution type the loan money was taken from. \\nLoan Prepayments  \\nPrepayment of loans, in full, is generally permitted at any time. Some plans may permit partial prepayment. Procedure for prepayment varies from plan to plan. \\nDeemed Distribution \\nMost loans are repaid by deductions from the employee‟s paycheck. Generally, when a participant with an outstanding loan goes on unpaid leave, the loan can be repaid manually by check or electronic fund transfer. If an active participant does not make the required payments, the loan will be considered a deemed distribution after a fixed period of time, usually 90 days.  \\nParticipants who have a deemed distribution will receive an IRS Form 1099-R in January of the year following the year in which the deemed distribution occurred. Deemed distributions are not eligible for rollover to a qualified plan or IRA. \\nIf a participant has a loan that is considered to be a deemed distribution, and the loan has not been repaid, he will generally not be allowed to request a new loan until the deemed loan is paid back. As of January 1, 2004, some plans may allow their participants with an unpaid loan considered as a deemed distribution to request a new loan if the participant enters into a payroll withholding agreement or provides the plan with adequate security for the loan. This policy may not apply to all our clients‟ plans. In other words, this policy may vary from client to client. \\nSuspension of loan repayments during an active military leave of absence will NOT cause the loan to be deemed distributed, even if the leave exceeds a year. The loan must be fully repaid by the end of the original term plus the period of the active military service. .  \\nSeparating from Service with an Outstanding Loan Balance \\nIf the participant separates from service with an outstanding loan balance, most employers require that the loan be repaid, in full, within a specified period of time after separation. If the loan is not repaid within the specified time, it is defaulted and reported as a taxable distribution for the year in which it is defaulted. \\nTaxation of Defaulted Loans \\nFailure to repay a loan after separating from service, according to the terms of the plan results in default of the loan. If the loan is defaulted, the outstanding loan balance is considered a taxable distribution and is thus subject to federal (and state, if applicable) income tax withholding for the year of the distribution. The participant receives an IRS Form 1099-R for the outstanding loan balance in January following the year of default. If the participant defaults on the loan after separating from service, the outstanding loan balance is reported as taxable income. \\n \\n \\n2.9 Withdrawal \\nAlthough the primary purpose of a 401(k) plan is to help employees save for retirement, many plans allow participants to withdraw money from their 401(k) plan (MS accounts while actively employed. Employers are not required to make withdrawals from 401(k) plans available to their participants. Therefore, the plans of different employers are structured differently, with some being more restrictive in their withdrawal provisions than others. If in-service withdrawals are permitted from the plan, the money withdrawn from the account cannot be paid back and is subject to taxation if not rolled over. \\nActively employed participants can make these three main types of withdrawals from their plan accounts: \\n Regular or ordinary withdrawal;   Hardship withdrawal; and   Age 59½ withdrawal.  \\nEach type of withdrawal has specific Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and plan restrictions controlling the money types available for withdrawal and the order of their withdrawal. \\n \\n\\t2.9.1 \\tTaxation of In-Service Withdrawals \\nUnder current federal tax law, participants are not required to pay federal, and in most cases, state and local income tax on contributions and their earnings in a 401(k) plan as long as they remain in the plan. Generally, whenever money is withdrawn or distributed from a 401(k) plan it becomes subject to taxation. Taxation varies depending on the money type withdrawn and the reason for the withdrawal in general \\nThe withdrawal is subject to a 20% mandatory federal income tax withholding, if not rolled over. The amount of the mandatory withholding may be more or less than the amount the participant owes in federal income tax. A participants actual tax liability for the withdrawal will depend on the participants own tax situation for example exemptions household income deductions etc Withholding for state taxes may also be required. \\n \\nAmounts obtained from in-service withdrawals may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if the participant is under age 59 ½. The plan does not withhold for the 10% penalty tax at the time of distribution; participants pay the penalty when they file their taxes.  \\n \\nAn IRS Form 1099-R is mailed to the participant in January of the year following the year in which the withdrawal is taken. For example, for a withdrawal taken in March of 2003, the participant receives a 1099-R in January 2004. This form shows the total amount of the withdrawal, the amount subject to tax, and the amount of federal and state tax withheld and forwarded to the IRS and state agencies. \\n \\n\\t2.9.2 \\tRegular Withdrawal  \\n Overview \\nA regular or ordinary withdrawal has the same basic characteristics of all in- service withdrawals: \\nThey are generally available only to actively employed participants;  \\nThe plan sponsor chooses the money or contribution types available; and establishes a withdrawal hierarchy.  \\n Contribution Types Available \\nThe types of contributions and associated earnings available for a regular withdrawal are chosen by the plan sponsor and may include:  \\nAfter-tax;  \\nRollover; and \\nEmployer contributions.  \\nRegular withdrawals do not include participant before-tax contributions or the associated earnings. ESOP, PAYSOP and TRASOP money is usually available for in-service withdrawals. \\n \\n \\n\\t2.9.3 \\tHardship Withdrawal \\nOverview  \\nParticipants with immediate and heavy financial need and no reasonable access to money from elsewhere can withdraw certain contributions from their 401(k) plans. The plan administrator determines whether the participant fulfills Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and plan-imposed hardship withdrawal requirements. He reviews the withdrawal request and associated documents and makes the determination based either on the “facts and circumstances” of each case or adoption of the Internal Revenue Code “safe harbor” guidelines or a combination of both.  \\nIRS Requirements \\nIRS regulations provide a narrow definition of hardship: The hardship must be caused by the immediate and heavy financial needs of the participant for which other resources are not reasonably available.  \\nTo qualify for a hardship withdrawal, the participant‟s request must pass a two-part test.  \\nthe qualifying need exists; and.  \\nno other resources are reasonably available to meet the need.  \\n       To determine the “existence of need” employers may use one of two methods:  \\nlRS Safe Harbors \\nFacts and Circumstances  \\n \\n\\t2.9.4 \\tAge 59 ½ Withdrawal \\nOverview  \\nActive participants age 59 ½ and older may take in-service withdrawals from their 401(k) plans. At age 59 ½, 401(k) plan participants may have access to more of their account. \\nContribution Types Available \\nIf the 401(k) plan allows, the participant may withdraw vested amounts from all types of contributions within individual plan limits. All participant contributions and associated earnings, including before tax monies, are made available for withdrawal at age 59 ½ Depending on plan provisions, employer contributions may be restricted. \\n \\n \\n2.10 Rollover \\nIn-Bound Rollovers  \\nEmployees may also contribute to a 401(k) plan by rolling over contributions. In-bound rollovers from another qualified plan or conduit IRA. Employees who have contributions in another qualified plan, usually from another employer, may be allowed to roll over these contributions to the current employer‟s plan to continue deferring the contributions from taxes. Beginning with plan years after December 31, 2001, taxable money in an IRA can be rolled to a 401(k) plan without using a conduit IRA.  \\n \\nIn-bound rollovers into a qualified plan may only contain taxable contributions and earnings. Beginning in 2002, after-tax contributions can be rolled over. Prior to 2002, after-tax contributions could not be rolled over, though the earnings on after-tax contributions were eligible for rollover since they had never been taxed. If a qualified plan accepts rollover of after-tax contributions, it must agree to account for the after-tax contributions separately.  \\n \\n \\n In-Bound Rollover Procedures  \\nThere are no regulations stating that employers must accept in-bound rollover contributions into their qualified plans. As a result, employers may or may not allow in-bound rollovers. Plans are required, however, to offer rollovers-out to other plans.  \\nIf rollovers-in are permitted in the plan, the following general procedures may apply: \\nEmployers may require employees to be able to participate in the 401(k) plan before rollovers-in will be accepted.  \\nEmployees may need to complete an in-bound rollover-in request form. The form will ask for the desired investment direction for the amount rolled over. \\nEmployees must attach the check from the previous plan or IRA.  \\nEmployees may need to provide documentation verifying that the in-bound rollover came from a qualified plan or a conduit IRA. Examples of this documentation include: letter of determination or a distribution statement.  \\n \\nOut - Bound Rollovers  \\nAt the time of distribution, the participant has the option to continue to defer taxation by rolling over all or a portion of the eligible account balance into an Individual Retirement Account or another qualified plan A direct rollover allows the participant to move the eligible account balance directly from one qualified plan to another or to an IRA Eligible account balances rolled into an IRA can subsequently be rolled into a qualified plan if it has been held in a conduit IRA (def An IRA that contains only taxable money from a qualified employer retirement plan It is not commingled with other money). \\n \\nBeginning in 2002 taxable money in an IRA can be rolled to a 401(k) plan without being held in a conduit IRA .Amounts that are eligible to be rolled over include employee before tax contributions and earnings, employer contributions and earnings, rollovers and associated earnings and aftertax contributions and associated earnings. Because of EGTRRA, after tax contributions are now eligible for a rollover. If the entire eligible account balance is rolled over, there are no tax consequences. The account balance is simply moving from one tax-deferred vehicle to another. \\n \\nIf at the time of distribution, participants elect to have their account balance paid directly to them, 20% of the taxable distribution will be withheld for federal income tax withholding. Withholding for state taxes may be required. A rollover option still exists however. Participants may choose to open their own IRA or make a rollover contribution to their new employer‟s qualified plan within60 days of the distribution. Participants may add their own money to make up all or a portion of the entire 20% that was withheld.  \\n \\nThe withholding tax paid to the IRS will be combined with all other taxes paid by the participant for the year. Participants may be due a refund when they file their tax return at year-end. \\n \\n \\n2.11 Distribution \\n Overview  \\nShareholders may take final distributions, upon termination, from a stock fund in the form of shares or cash. In certain types of plans, the employer may be required to offer the distribution in the form of shares Upon distribution it is up to the participant to decide whether to take the shares or receive the value of the shares as cash instead. When a participant chooses a share distribution, fractional shares in a participant‟s account are paid in cash. \\nFor example, a participant elects to take a distribution in shares. At the time of the distribution, she has a dollar value in her account of $1,520. The shares are valued at $50 a share. She would receive 30 shares of stock (30 X $50 = $1,500) and $20 in cash. \\n Participants qualify for final distribution of their vested account balances when they: \\nSeparate from service (retirement or otherwise);  \\nQualify as disabled under the specific plan guidelines;  \\nDie, in which case the account balance can be distributed to their designated beneficiary. \\nFinal distributions can be paid in several ways. Some forms of payment are required while others are not. Forms of payment include:  \\nA lump sum payment;  \\nDeferred payment; \\nInstallments; and \\nAn annuity, although these are rare.  \\nWhen a participant dies, the beneficiary is entitled to payment of the account balance. If the participant is married at the time of death, the beneficiary would automatically be the spouse. If the spouse has signed a valid consent/waiver, the participant may name someone else as beneficiary to receive amounts in the 401(k) plan after the participant‟s death. Spousal beneficiaries have the option to defer distribution until the participant would have been 70Y2. Non-spousal beneficiaries must receive a distribution no later than five years after the participant‟s death. The employer decides which payment options, besides those legally required, are offered by the plan. \\n\\t2.11.1 \\tFinal Distribution Requirements \\nWhen a participant retires, leaves the company, or becomes disabled the participant can elect to: \\nReceive a distribution, or \\nLeave the money in the plan until a later date (defer the payment)  provided the vested account balance is greater than the plan‟s cash out  level (see below). \\nIf the participant leaves the account balance in the plan:  \\nTaxes will continue to be deferred until the participant receives the  money.  \\nThe balance of the account that remains in the plan will share in gains  or losses of the investment funds.  \\nInvestment changes may be made according to the rules of the  individual plan.  \\nThe participant can request a final distribution at any time in the future.  \\nThe forms of payment for final distribution must include a lump sum payment option; however, the plan sponsor does have some discretion. For example, the plan sponsor may or may not offer installment and/or annuity payments.  \\n \\nCash out Amounts \\nWhen participants request a final distribution, they receive a distribution package, which explains payment options as well as the rollover option. For administrative convenience, ERISA permits 401(k) plan balances at or below a certain level, referred to as the cash out amount, to be paid out after separation from service of employment without the participant‟s consent. The current threshold is a vested account balance of $5,000 or less. Plan sponsors have the choice to implement this option.  \\nIf the vested account balance is greater than $5,000, IRC regulations require the participant‟s consent before making a lump sum distribution. Without the participant‟s consent, the distribution will be deferred.  \\nIf the vested account balance is $5,000 or less, then the lump sum payment may be distributed without the participant‟s consent. The participant must be given an opportunity to elect a direct rollover of the eligible account balance.  \\nPayment Options  \\nIf participants choose to receive a distribution from the plan, they may be able to choose from various payment options, which may include:  \\nLump sum paid to the participant - the participant‟s vested account balance is distributed to the participant. The plan administrator automatically deducts the mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding from the distribution. The distribution may also be subject to the 10% penalty tax if the participant is under the age of 59 ½ and not otherwise exempt. Withholding for state taxes may also be required. \\n \\nLump sum rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA - the participant‟s vested account balance is distributed to the qualified plan or IRA. There is no federal income tax withholding. \\nInstallment - a specific number of payments of approximately equal value. The payment amount is calculated based on the number of payments requested. An example of an installment payment option would be a provision, which allows participants to elect up to 20 annual installments. Installment payments of ten years or less are eligible to be rolled over.  \\nAnnuity - a series of regular payments, guaranteed to continue for a specific time, usually the participant‟s lifetime. The payment amount is calculated based on the life expectancy of the participant or the participant and the joint beneficiary (using IRS actuarial tables). Annuities are rare in 401(k) plans.  \\n \\nIf the participant defers payment, the participant may come back at any time and request a distribution. The ability of a participant to leave money in the 401(k) plan account depends on whether it is above the cash out level ($5,000). If the balance of the account is above the cash out level, a participant cannot be forced to take a distribution. Ievel, a participant cannot be forced to take a distribution.  \\n Taxation of Final Distributions \\nAs with withdrawals, final distributions are subject to the mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding, and the 10% penalty tax if the participant is under age 59¼ and not otherwise exempt, unless the distribution is directly rolled over Withholding of state taxes may also be required.  \\nThe 10% penalty tax does not apply if the final distribution is made \\nAfter age 59 ½;  \\nBecause of separation from service at or after age 55 (separation includes leaving the company for any reason or retirement);  \\nPayable in the form of periodic payment;  \\nOn account of a QDRO; or \\nFor certain medical expenses (those that are deductible for income tax purpose; unreimbursed medical expenses must exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. \\n\\t2.11.2 \\tMinimum Required Distribution  \\nOverview  \\nAge 70 ½ minimum required distributions, more commonly known as, Minimum Required Distributions (MRDs), mandate certain 401(k) plan participants receive certain minimum payment from their account balances beginning at age 70 ½. MRDs apply to all qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans and pension plans. MRDs also apply to IRAs. \\nRequirements \\nThe IRC requires participants to begin receiving MRDs from a 401(k) plan no later than April 1 following the year in which the participant reaches age 70 ½. \\nMRDs are paid annually. The first payment must begin by April 1 of the year following the year in which the participant turns 70 ½ Subsequent distributions must be paid by December 31 of each year. Consequently, there may be two payments received in the first year.  \\nIf the participant fails to receive an annual minimum required distribution during the required time frame, the individual may incur a tax penalty equal to 50% of the amount that should have been distributed.  \\nBeginning in 1997, active participants in 401(k) plans who are over age 70 ½ can delay commencement of MRDs until the later of retirement or separation from service. \\nNote, this does not apply to IRA participants or 401(k) plan participants who own 5% or more of the company. The IRS requires them to begin receiving MRDs at age 70 ½.  \\nThe MRD calculation is based on the participant‟s life expectancy, or the joint life expectancies of the participant and designated beneficiary based on actuarial tables set forth by the IRS. \\n Taxation of 70 ½ Minimum Required Distributions \\nThe mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding does not apply to MRDs. Instead, the recipient is required to make a federal income tax withholding election on IRS Form W-4P. In some cases, if the participant fails to make a withholding election before the annual payment is made, the plan withholds federal income tax based on a default election. An MRD is not eligible for rollover. Participants can no longer defer paying taxes on this money once the MRD has been paid to them.\"}]}', NULL, '<h1>Retirement and Financial Services Overview</h1>\n<main>\n  <p>Retirement benefit programs aim to secure employee and family well-being.

Some benefit plans, such as health insurance and dental insurance, provide for their immediate well being. Other benefit plans promise to provide financial security at retirement. There are a number of ways employers provide retirement benefits for their employees. Most employers will use defined benefit, or pension plans, and/or defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits. The most common type of defined contribution plan is the 401(k) plan.  \\nEmployers have various methods of providing retirement benefits for their employees. Today, more and more employers are asking their employees to share in the responsibility for their retirement. One of the ways employers ask employees to share the cost is through a 401(k) retirement plan. Employees can save for their retirement and also provide an immediate tax savings for themselves and their employer by participating in a 401(k) plan. A 401(k) plan participant decides, within plan limits: how much to contribute, where to invest the contributions, and how long the contributions remain in the plan.  \\nHighly Compensated Employees  \\nUnder ERISA guidelines for plan qualification, a plan may not discriminate in favor of any particular group of employees, such as highly compensated employees (HOEs). Employees are considered highly compensated if:  \\n \\nThey own 5% or more of the company, or  \\nThey have earned $90,000 or more during the previous year (effective for year 2003). For 2004, the amount will remain at $90,000. \\nQualified Plan \\nQualified plans are plans that meet strict IRS requirements. 401(k) plans are a type of qualified plan \\n \\n\\n\\n2.2 Types of Plan \\nOverview \\nEmployers who provide employees with a retirement benefit have a choice whether to use the defined benefit (DB) plan design, commonly called a pension plan or the defined contribution (DC) plan design. For many years the DB plan was the primary method used by employers to provide a retirement benefit. In recent years, employers have turned to a popular DC plan method known as a 401(k) plan. \\nSome employers offer both types of plans while others offer neither. However, most employers elect to offer at least one type of plan to receive the immediate tax & retirement benefit.  \\nDefined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution \\nDefined benefit pension plans and defined contribution savings plans are both designed to provide the employee with retirement income. Some of the common differences between the DB and DC plans are listed in the following chart.  \\n\\t \\tDefined Benefit Plan \\tDefined Contribution Plan \\nThe employer funds it. \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\tEmployee and employer contributions are allocated to individual participants. The participant may have to contribute to receive a benefit. \\nThe employer bears the investment risk. \\t \\t \\t \\tThe participant bears the investment risk. \\nIt is generally difficult to communicate.  \\t \\t \\t \\tIt is easier to communicate.  \\nThere is a definite benefit formula. \\t \\t \\t \\tThe final retirement benefit is unknown. \\nThe benefit is expressed as an annuity  payable at normal retirement age, usually  age 65.  \\t \\tThe benefit is expressed as an account balance. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nThe following plans are designated as defined contribution plans:  \\n401(k) plans \\nProfit sharing plans  \\nThrift plans  \\n403(b) and 457 plans  \\nEmployee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)  \\n \\nThe 401(k) plan is the most popular form of defined contribution plan used by employers today.  \\n \\n2.3 Eligibility  \\nOverview \\nWhen an employer decides to offer a 401(k) plan, it must determine, within ERISA guidelines who will be permitted to participate and how eligibility will be defined. Although ERISA dictates many of the parameters plans must follow it also gives employers some choices when setting eligibility requirements for 401(k) plan participation  \\nEmployers may choose to limit eligibility based on:  \\nAge:  Under ERISA, a plan may limit participation to employees age 21 and over. Plans may choose to allow participation before age 21. \\nService: The maximum service requirement a 401(k) plan can impose for eligibility to participate, by law, is one year. A plan may choose to impose a service requirement as a cost savings measure, especially in industries where there is high turnover in the first year of employment.  \\nNote: DC plans other than 401(k) plans may require two years of service for             eligibility; however, employees entering the plan after two years must be 100% vested immediately upon entering the plan.      \\nEmployment classification:  Employers may choose to only allow full-time and/or permanent employees to participate, thereby excluding part-time and/or temporary employees. \\nNo eligibility requirements: Some plans may choose to have no eligibility restrictions. In this case, all employees would have the option to begin participating immediately upon hire.  \\nService:  If an employer chooses to impose a service requirement, the plan must decide how it will calculate one year of service. ERISA allows a number of methods for calculating when one year of service has been completed including:  \\n \\n \\n                                                    \\n                                                    \\n2\\n \\nC3    -Protected \\t \\tPage 2 of 169 \\nUn-controlled when printed \\n \\n\\n1,000 Hours Method \\tElapsed Time Method \\nThe most common method is to determine if the employee has completed at least 1,000 hours of service in the 12-month period following the date of hire. \\tThis option does not count hours, only the specific length of service, such as one year from the date of hire. \\n\\n \\nEntry Dates \\nERISA allows employers to establish specific times of the year when employees can enroll in 401(k) plans. These are called entry dates. The designated enrollment dates may be quarterly, monthly, or by payroll cycle. Entry dates relieve plans from the possible administrative task of enrolling new participants on a daily basis.  \\nERISA requires that the use of entry dates may not delay entry into the plan by more than six months after the employee has met the plan‟s eligibility requirements. \\n \\n2.4 Contribution \\n401(k) plans offer employers opportunities for flexible plan design within the requirements established by (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and the Department of Labor (DOL).  401 (k) plans may be offered in several different ways with several different contribution options. Some 401(k) plans have employee contributions only and others have both employee and employer contributions. 401(k) plans may have only before-tax contributions or they may have both before- and after-tax contributions.  \\nEmployee Contributions \\nInternal Revenue Code section 401 (a) (17) limits the annual amount of pay a qualified plan may consider in calculating tax-deferred contributions or benefits. This is known as the Maximum Compensation Limit, which limits the amount of pay that is eligible for all contributions. The limit for 2004 is $205,000.  \\nThis means that an employee who earns over this amount annually will be recognized as only earning $205,000 for 401(k) plan purposes. The limit is periodically adjusted by the IRS to reflect changes in the cost of living index. \\nEmployee Before-Tax Contributions \\nDeductions taken from the employee‟s paycheck on a before-tax basis are applied before taxes are taken out of the employee‟s gross income. Only Social Security and Medicare taxes are deducted prior to any before-tax contributions. Before-tax contributions reduce the participant‟s current taxable income. Before-tax contributions are also commonly referred to as pre-tax. \\nEmployee After - Tax Contributions \\nDeductions taken from the employee‟s paycheck on an after-tax basis are applied after all taxes have been taken out of the employee‟s gross income. After-tax contributions are also commonly referred to as post-tax. \\n \\nEmployer Contributions  \\nIn addition to employees making contributions, some employers make contributions on behalf of the employees. Employers may choose to provide these contributions to encourage employee participation in the 401(k) plan and/or attract and retain skilled employees. Employer contributions are considered before-tax contributions and remain tax deferred until withdrawn. Some employers may choose to provide: \\nA matching contribution based on the contributions the participant makes ;  \\nContributions based on the annual profits of the company; \\nBoth types of employer contributions; and  Neither type of employer contributions. \\nEmployer Matching Contributions  \\nMatching contributions are usually a percentage of the participant‟s compensation and are tied to the amount the participant contributes.  \\nEmployers frequently place a limit on the amount of the match. Only employees who have chosen to contribute to the 401(k) plan receive matching contributions.  \\nEmployer Discretionary Contributions \\nDiscretionary contributions can be provided in addition to, or instead of, employer matching contributions. One example of a discretionary contribution is a profit sharing contribution. \\nDiscretionary contributions may change each year and are generally tied to annual profits. \\n\\tEmployers \\tmay \\toffer \\tdiscretionary \\tcontributions \\tone \\tyear \\tand \\tnone \\tthe \\tnext. \\nDiscretionary contributions are made on behalf of all eligible employees even if they choose not to contribute to the 401(k) plan \\n \\n \\n \\n2.5 Vesting \\n\\t2.5.1 \\tOverview  \\nVesting refers to the ownership in all or a portion of the company’s matching contributions or discretionary contributions and the earnings on these contributions. A participant is always 100% vested in employee and rollover contributions and the earnings on those contributions. Employer contributions such as matching or discretionary contributions may be subject to a vesting schedule. \\n\\t2.5.2 \\tVesting Credit  \\nA participant gains ownership of employer contributions and the earnings associated with those contributions according to a schedule referred to as Vesting Schedule, Under ERISA, an employer generally must give credit for a year of vesting for any year in which the employee worked 1,000 hours or more. \\nEmployers may also determine vesting based on elapsed time. Elapsed time does not count hours. An employee receives vesting credit after completing a specific length of service.  \\nERISA provides minimum standards for two types of vesting schedules: cliff and graded. \\nHowever, 401(k) plans may choose to be more generous than the ERISA requirements.  \\nCliff Vesting Schedule \\nIn a cliff vesting schedule, the participant becomes fully vested in the employer contributions and associated earnings after a certain period of time. No partial vesting occurs. For employer contributions for plan years beginning n 2002, a participant must be fully vested after completing three years of vesting service. \\n \\nERISA MINIMUM - CLIFF SCHEDULE \\nYears of Service  \\tVesting %  \\nLess than 3 years  \\t0%  \\n3 years or more  \\t100%  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nGraded Vesting Schedule  \\nIn a graded vesting schedule, the participant becomes vested in the employer contributions and associated earnings gradually over a period of time. For plan years beginning in 2002, ERISA requires that a participant must be fully vested after six years of vesting service. The participant must be at least 20% vested after two years, 40% after three years, 60% after four years, 80% vested after five years of vesting service, and 100% after six years of vesting service.  \\nA plan may be more generous and offer a two-year cliff, for example. \\n\\nERISA MINIMUM - GRADED SCHEDULE  \\nYears of Service  \\tVesting %  \\nLess than 2 years  \\t0%  \\n2 years  \\t20%  \\n3 years  \\t40%  \\n4 years  \\t60%  \\n5 years  \\t80%  \\n6 years  \\t100%  \\n\\n \\nA plan may be more generous and offer a four-year graded schedule, for example, where the participant is fully vested after four years of vesting service. \\n \\n \\n2.6 Forfeitures \\nIf a participant leaves the company before being fully vested, the participant may forfeit all or a portion of the employer contributions and associated earnings. The Exclusive Benefit Rule states that forfeited amounts cannot be returned to the employer, but must be used for the plan‟s participants. The employer can either apply these forfeited amounts to reduce future employer contributions or reallocate forfeitures among the remaining plan participants.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.7 Account Activity  \\nPlan representatives and administrators have the ability to routinely process transactions for participants. They have access to each participant‟s account information to process requisitions to:  \\nChange contribution rates;  \\nChange future investment directions;  \\nMove existing balances from one fund to another; and   Respond to information requests.  \\nThese transactions are processed based on the plan‟s valuation cycle. Participants generally complete these types of transactions through an automated touch-tone phone system or a web site and then receive a confirmation statement. Participants may also contact a plan representative to assist them with the transaction.  \\nContribution Rate Changes  \\nWhen participants first enroll in a 401(k) plan, they must elect the amount they want to contribute to the plan. This amount is expressed as a percentage of eligible compensation. If the 40 1(k) plan permits before-tax and after-tax contributions, the participant elects how much will be contributed on a before-tax and/or after-tax basis.  \\nAfter the initial enrollment, participants may wish to change the percentage of compensation they contribute throughout the year. The plan may, however, limit the number of times a participant can make a change in any plan year. Contribution rate changes are typically processed. Only one or two times per month-usually based on the participant‟s payroll cycle.  \\nChanges cannot exceed plan limits. For example, a 401(k) plan may permit a NHCE participant to contribute between 1% and 15% of eligible compensation. The plan may restrict HCE participants to contribution elections between 1% and 8% of eligible compensation.  \\nInvestment Direction  \\nAn investment direction election determines where future contributions and loan repayments should be invested. Investment directions generally must be made in increments of 1% and must total 100%. A participant‟s investment strategy may change or the participant may want to respond to market changes, and therefore, redirect where the contributions are invested. The investment direction election has no effect on existing balances in the investment funds. \\nFund Transfers \\nFund transfers move balances directly from one investment fund to another investment fund to another investment fund or funds. The participant determines the percentages to be transferred. Participants may make this election through the automated touch-tone system, web site or plan representative.  \\nFund Reallocations  \\nFund reallocations (sometimes called balance reallocations) require the participant to indicate, in whole percentages, an amount for each of the investment choices. The participant may elect a zero percentage for some of the funds. Theoretically, it is as though the participant takes all the money in all the funds and holds it in her hands. She then has to decide, in whole percentages, where the money is to be invested. The total must equal 100%.  \\n2.8 Loans \\n Overview  \\nIf the plan has a loan provision, participants may borrow money from their 401(k) plan account. A plan loan is an agreement that allows participants to borrow from their account and repay the principal, with interest, back into the account, generally repaid through payroll deductions. If the loan is repaid on schedule, no tax liability is incurred; however, failure to repay will result in default of the loan and tax consequences to the participant.\\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) & Internal Revenue Service (IRS) imposes several plan loan restrictions to ensure that loan provisions are designed in a nondiscriminatory manner with regard to: \\nAvailability; \\nInterest rates; \\nThe security of the loan and  Administrative procedures.  \\nLoan amounts;  \\nThe duration of the loan; and  Taxes. \\nAlthough 401(k) plans are not required to offer loans, an employer may choose to offer one or both of the following loan: \\nGeneral purpose loan (also referred to as a general loan) \\nHome loan (also referred to as a primary residence loan)  \\nERISA imposes restrictions on the maximum duration of a loan. Typically, a general purpose loan must be repaid within 5 years. A home loan may be extended beyond the five years period (that is, 5, 10, 15 or 20 years or other period). If participant is refinancing a home loan, the new loan will need to be paid off within the original term of the loan.   \\n \\nThe IRS restricts maximum loan amounts. If the plan permits, a participant may have more than one loan outstanding. However, the maximum amount a participant may borrow at any one time is $50,000 of his vested account balance (VAB). Under ERISA, the VAB includes outstanding loan balances (OLBs).  \\n \\nThe amount a participant may borrow is determined by using the following formula:  \\nThe lesser of:  \\n1/2 (Vested Account Balance + Outstanding Loan Balance)-Outstanding Loan Balance  or  \\n$50,000 minus the highest Outstanding Loan Balance in the past 12 months  (The highest OLB can come from loans currently outstanding or loans that were  paid in full during the past 12 months.)  \\n \\nFor example, if a plan sets a minimum loan amount of $1 000, the participant‟s vested account balance must be at least $2000 with no outstanding loans. \\n \\nThe plan may restrict a particular type of contribution (for example, employer match) from being borrowed, yet allow those contributions to be included in the account balance recognized in the maximum loan amount calculation.  \\nThe amount available for a participant to borrow is based on the vested value of the account on the day he requests for the loan, since the loan is actually paid from the participant‟s account on the date it is processed. It is likely that the participant‟s vested account balance has changed. However, it is important to note that the 50% rule pertains to the vested account balance at the time of the request, not at the time the loan is processed. \\nLoan money comes from the before-tax money type, which includes:  \\nEmployee before-tax contributions;  \\nEmployer match;  \\nPrevious rollover monies; and  \\nThe earnings from these monies.  \\nIn some cases, after-tax contributions are also included. The plan determines the order of the money types used to provide loan. For example, some plans may require loan amounts to come from rollover money first, then employee before-tax contributions, then employer contributions, and last employee after-tax contributions. \\nLoan Repayments \\nParticipants must repay loans according to the terms agreed to under the plan, but no less frequently than quarterly. Generally, loan repayments are made through payroll deductions each pay period with after tax dollars. Exceptions may occur, however. A participant can be on unpaid leave, for example, and make payments from a personal check or electronic fund transfer, if the plan allows. An amortization schedule shows how the portion of each repayment applies to the outstanding interest and principal. \\nThe money is usually repaid according to the current investment direction elected by the participant and is repaid to its original money type even though it is deducted from the participants paycheck after taxes are taken out. Therefore the investment funds the loan is paid from will often not be the same investment funds to which repayment is made. However the repayment is made into the contribution type the loan money was taken from. \\nLoan Prepayments  \\nPrepayment of loans, in full, is generally permitted at any time. Some plans may permit partial prepayment. Procedure for prepayment varies from plan to plan. \\nDeemed Distribution \\nMost loans are repaid by deductions from the employee‟s paycheck. Generally, when a participant with an outstanding loan goes on unpaid leave, the loan can be repaid manually by check or electronic fund transfer. If an active participant does not make the required payments, the loan will be considered a deemed distribution after a fixed period of time, usually 90 days.  \\nParticipants who have a deemed distribution will receive an IRS Form 1099-R in January of the year following the year in which the deemed distribution occurred. Deemed distributions are not eligible for rollover to a qualified plan or IRA. \\nIf a participant has a loan that is considered to be a deemed distribution, and the loan has not been repaid, he will generally not be allowed to request a new loan until the deemed loan is paid back. As of January 1, 2004, some plans may allow their participants with an unpaid loan considered as a deemed distribution to request a new loan if the participant enters into a payroll withholding agreement or provides the plan with adequate security for the loan. This policy may not apply to all our clients‟ plans. In other words, this policy may vary from client to client. \\nSuspension of loan repayments during an active military leave of absence will NOT cause the loan to be deemed distributed, even if the leave exceeds a year. The loan must be fully repaid by the end of the original term plus the period of the active military service. .  \\nSeparating from Service with an Outstanding Loan Balance \\nIf the participant separates from service with an outstanding loan balance, most employers require that the loan be repaid, in full, within a specified period of time after separation. If the loan is not repaid within the specified time, it is defaulted and reported as a taxable distribution for the year in which it is defaulted. \\nTaxation of Defaulted Loans \\nFailure to repay a loan after separating from service, according to the terms of the plan results in default of the loan. If the loan is defaulted, the outstanding loan balance is considered a taxable distribution and is thus subject to federal (and state, if applicable) income tax withholding for the year of the distribution. The participant receives an IRS Form 1099-R for the outstanding loan balance in January following the year of default. If the participant defaults on the loan after separating from service, the outstanding loan balance is reported as taxable income. \\n \\n \\n2.9 Withdrawal \\nAlthough the primary purpose of a 401(k) plan is to help employees save for retirement, many plans allow participants to withdraw money from their 401(k) plan (MS accounts while actively employed. Employers are not required to make withdrawals from 401(k) plans available to their participants. Therefore, the plans of different employers are structured differently, with some being more restrictive in their withdrawal provisions than others. If in-service withdrawals are permitted from the plan, the money withdrawn from the account cannot be paid back and is subject to taxation if not rolled over. \\nActively employed participants can make these three main types of withdrawals from their plan accounts: \\n Regular or ordinary withdrawal;   Hardship withdrawal; and   Age 59½ withdrawal.  \\nEach type of withdrawal has specific Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and plan restrictions controlling the money types available for withdrawal and the order of their withdrawal. \\n \\n\\t2.9.1 \\tTaxation of In-Service Withdrawals \\nUnder current federal tax law, participants are not required to pay federal, and in most cases, state and local income tax on contributions and their earnings in a 401(k) plan as long as they remain in the plan. Generally, whenever money is withdrawn or distributed from a 401(k) plan it becomes subject to taxation. Taxation varies depending on the money type withdrawn and the reason for the withdrawal in general \\nThe withdrawal is subject to a 20% mandatory federal income tax withholding, if not rolled over. The amount of the mandatory withholding may be more or less than the amount the participant owes in federal income tax. A participants actual tax liability for the withdrawal will depend on the participants own tax situation for example exemptions household income deductions etc Withholding for state taxes may also be required. \\n \\nAmounts obtained from in-service withdrawals may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if the participant is under age 59 ½. The plan does not withhold for the 10% penalty tax at the time of distribution; participants pay the penalty when they file their taxes.  \\n \\nAn IRS Form 1099-R is mailed to the participant in January of the year following the year in which the withdrawal is taken. For example, for a withdrawal taken in March of 2003, the participant receives a 1099-R in January 2004. This form shows the total amount of the withdrawal, the amount subject to tax, and the amount of federal and state tax withheld and forwarded to the IRS and state agencies. \\n \\n\\t2.9.2 \\tRegular Withdrawal  \\n Overview \\nA regular or ordinary withdrawal has the same basic characteristics of all in- service withdrawals: \\nThey are generally available only to actively employed participants;  \\nThe plan sponsor chooses the money or contribution types available; and establishes a withdrawal hierarchy.  \\n Contribution Types Available \\nThe types of contributions and associated earnings available for a regular withdrawal are chosen by the plan sponsor and may include:  \\nAfter-tax;  \\nRollover; and \\nEmployer contributions.  \\nRegular withdrawals do not include participant before-tax contributions or the associated earnings. ESOP, PAYSOP and TRASOP money is usually available for in-service withdrawals. \\n \\n \\n\\t2.9.3 \\tHardship Withdrawal \\nOverview  \\nParticipants with immediate and heavy financial need and no reasonable access to money from elsewhere can withdraw certain contributions from their 401(k) plans. The plan administrator determines whether the participant fulfills Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and plan-imposed hardship withdrawal requirements. He reviews the withdrawal request and associated documents and makes the determination based either on the “facts and circumstances” of each case or adoption of the Internal Revenue Code “safe harbor” guidelines or a combination of both.  \\nIRS Requirements \\nIRS regulations provide a narrow definition of hardship: The hardship must be caused by the immediate and heavy financial needs of the participant for which other resources are not reasonably available.  \\nTo qualify for a hardship withdrawal, the participant‟s request must pass a two-part test.  \\nthe qualifying need exists; and.  \\nno other resources are reasonably available to meet the need.  \\n       To determine the “existence of need” employers may use one of two methods:  \\nlRS Safe Harbors \\nFacts and Circumstances  \\n \\n\\t2.9.4 \\tAge 59 ½ Withdrawal \\nOverview  \\nActive participants age 59 ½ and older may take in-service withdrawals from their 401(k) plans. At age 59 ½, 401(k) plan participants may have access to more of their account. \\nContribution Types Available \\nIf the 401(k) plan allows, the participant may withdraw vested amounts from all types of contributions within individual plan limits. All participant contributions and associated earnings, including before tax monies, are made available for withdrawal at age 59 ½ Depending on plan provisions, employer contributions may be restricted. \\n \\n \\n2.10 Rollover \\nIn-Bound Rollovers  \\nEmployees may also contribute to a 401(k) plan by rolling over contributions. In-bound rollovers from another qualified plan or conduit IRA. Employees who have contributions in another qualified plan, usually from another employer, may be allowed to roll over these contributions to the current employer‟s plan to continue deferring the contributions from taxes. Beginning with plan years after December 31, 2001, taxable money in an IRA can be rolled to a 401(k) plan without using a conduit IRA.  \\n \\nIn-bound rollovers into a qualified plan may only contain taxable contributions and earnings. Beginning in 2002, after-tax contributions can be rolled over. Prior to 2002, after-tax contributions could not be rolled over, though the earnings on after-tax contributions were eligible for rollover since they had never been taxed. If a qualified plan accepts rollover of after-tax contributions, it must agree to account for the after-tax contributions separately.  \\n \\n \\n In-Bound Rollover Procedures  \\nThere are no regulations stating that employers must accept in-bound rollover contributions into their qualified plans. As a result, employers may or may not allow in-bound rollovers. Plans are required, however, to offer rollovers-out to other plans.  \\nIf rollovers-in are permitted in the plan, the following general procedures may apply: \\nEmployers may require employees to be able to participate in the 401(k) plan before rollovers-in will be accepted.  \\nEmployees may need to complete an in-bound rollover-in request form. The form will ask for the desired investment direction for the amount rolled over. \\nEmployees must attach the check from the previous plan or IRA.  \\nEmployees may need to provide documentation verifying that the in-bound rollover came from a qualified plan or a conduit IRA. Examples of this documentation include: letter of determination or a distribution statement.  \\n \\nOut - Bound Rollovers  \\nAt the time of distribution, the participant has the option to continue to defer taxation by rolling over all or a portion of the eligible account balance into an Individual Retirement Account or another qualified plan A direct rollover allows the participant to move the eligible account balance directly from one qualified plan to another or to an IRA Eligible account balances rolled into an IRA can subsequently be rolled into a qualified plan if it has been held in a conduit IRA (def An IRA that contains only taxable money from a qualified employer retirement plan It is not commingled with other money). \\n \\nBeginning in 2002 taxable money in an IRA can be rolled to a 401(k) plan without being held in a conduit IRA .Amounts that are eligible to be rolled over include employee before tax contributions and earnings, employer contributions and earnings, rollovers and associated earnings and aftertax contributions and associated earnings. Because of EGTRRA, after tax contributions are now eligible for a rollover. If the entire eligible account balance is rolled over, there are no tax consequences. The account balance is simply moving from one tax-deferred vehicle to another. \\n \\nIf at the time of distribution, participants elect to have their account balance paid directly to them, 20% of the taxable distribution will be withheld for federal income tax withholding. Withholding for state taxes may be required. A rollover option still exists however. Participants may choose to open their own IRA or make a rollover contribution to their new employer‟s qualified plan within60 days of the distribution. Participants may add their own money to make up all or a portion of the entire 20% that was withheld.  \\n \\nThe withholding tax paid to the IRS will be combined with all other taxes paid by the participant for the year. Participants may be due a refund when they file their tax return at year-end. \\n \\n \\n2.11 Distribution \\n Overview  \\nShareholders may take final distributions, upon termination, from a stock fund in the form of shares or cash. In certain types of plans, the employer may be required to offer the distribution in the form of shares Upon distribution it is up to the participant to decide whether to take the shares or receive the value of the shares as cash instead. When a participant chooses a share distribution, fractional shares in a participant‟s account are paid in cash. \\nFor example, a participant elects to take a distribution in shares. At the time of the distribution, she has a dollar value in her account of $1,520. The shares are valued at $50 a share. She would receive 30 shares of stock (30 X $50 = $1,500) and $20 in cash. \\n Participants qualify for final distribution of their vested account balances when they: \\nSeparate from service (retirement or otherwise);  \\nQualify as disabled under the specific plan guidelines;  \\nDie, in which case the account balance can be distributed to their designated beneficiary. \\nFinal distributions can be paid in several ways. Some forms of payment are required while others are not. Forms of payment include:  \\nA lump sum payment;  \\nDeferred payment; \\nInstallments; and \\nAn annuity, although these are rare.  \\nWhen a participant dies, the beneficiary is entitled to payment of the account balance. If the participant is married at the time of death, the beneficiary would automatically be the spouse. If the spouse has signed a valid consent/waiver, the participant may name someone else as beneficiary to receive amounts in the 401(k) plan after the participant‟s death. Spousal beneficiaries have the option to defer distribution until the participant would have been 70Y2. Non-spousal beneficiaries must receive a distribution no later than five years after the participant‟s death. The employer decides which payment options, besides those legally required, are offered by the plan. \\n\\t2.11.1 \\tFinal Distribution Requirements \\nWhen a participant retires, leaves the company, or becomes disabled the participant can elect to: \\nReceive a distribution, or \\nLeave the money in the plan until a later date (defer the payment)  provided the vested account balance is greater than the plan‟s cash out  level (see below). \\nIf the participant leaves the account balance in the plan:  \\nTaxes will continue to be deferred until the participant receives the  money.  \\nThe balance of the account that remains in the plan will share in gains  or losses of the investment funds.  \\nInvestment changes may be made according to the rules of the  individual plan.  \\nThe participant can request a final distribution at any time in the future.  \\nThe forms of payment for final distribution must include a lump sum payment option; however, the plan sponsor does have some discretion. For example, the plan sponsor may or may not offer installment and/or annuity payments.  \\n \\nCash out Amounts \\nWhen participants request a final distribution, they receive a distribution package, which explains payment options as well as the rollover option. For administrative convenience, ERISA permits 401(k) plan balances at or below a certain level, referred to as the cash out amount, to be paid out after separation from service of employment without the participant‟s consent. The current threshold is a vested account balance of $5,000 or less. Plan sponsors have the choice to implement this option.  \\nIf the vested account balance is greater than $5,000, IRC regulations require the participant‟s consent before making a lump sum distribution. Without the participant‟s consent, the distribution will be deferred.  \\nIf the vested account balance is $5,000 or less, then the lump sum payment may be distributed without the participant‟s consent. The participant must be given an opportunity to elect a direct rollover of the eligible account balance.  \\nPayment Options  \\nIf participants choose to receive a distribution from the plan, they may be able to choose from various payment options, which may include:  \\nLump sum paid to the participant - the participant‟s vested account balance is distributed to the participant. The plan administrator automatically deducts the mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding from the distribution. The distribution may also be subject to the 10% penalty tax if the participant is under the age of 59 ½ and not otherwise exempt. Withholding for state taxes may also be required. \\n \\nLump sum rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA - the participant‟s vested account balance is distributed to the qualified plan or IRA. There is no federal income tax withholding. \\nInstallment - a specific number of payments of approximately equal value. The payment amount is calculated based on the number of payments requested. An example of an installment payment option would be a provision, which allows participants to elect up to 20 annual installments. Installment payments of ten years or less are eligible to be rolled over.  \\nAnnuity - a series of regular payments, guaranteed to continue for a specific time, usually the participant‟s lifetime. The payment amount is calculated based on the life expectancy of the participant or the participant and the joint beneficiary (using IRS actuarial tables). Annuities are rare in 401(k) plans.  \\n \\nIf the participant defers payment, the participant may come back at any time and request a distribution. The ability of a participant to leave money in the 401(k) plan account depends on whether it is above the cash out level ($5,000). If the balance of the account is above the cash out level, a participant cannot be forced to take a distribution. Ievel, a participant cannot be forced to take a distribution.  \\n Taxation of Final Distributions \\nAs with withdrawals, final distributions are subject to the mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding, and the 10% penalty tax if the participant is under age 59¼ and not otherwise exempt, unless the distribution is directly rolled over Withholding of state taxes may also be required.  \\nThe 10% penalty tax does not apply if the final distribution is made \\nAfter age 59 ½;  \\nBecause of separation from service at or after age 55 (separation includes leaving the company for any reason or retirement);  \\nPayable in the form of periodic payment;  \\nOn account of a QDRO; or \\nFor certain medical expenses (those that are deductible for income tax purpose; unreimbursed medical expenses must exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. \\n\\t2.11.2 \\tMinimum Required Distribution  \\nOverview  \\nAge 70 ½ minimum required distributions, more commonly known as, Minimum Required Distributions (MRDs), mandate certain 401(k) plan participants receive certain minimum payment from their account balances beginning at age 70 ½. MRDs apply to all qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans and pension plans. MRDs also apply to IRAs. \\nRequirements \\nThe IRC requires participants to begin receiving MRDs from a 401(k) plan no later than April 1 following the year in which the participant reaches age 70 ½. \\nMRDs are paid annually. The first payment must begin by April 1 of the year following the year in which the participant turns 70 ½ Subsequent distributions must be paid by December 31 of each year. Consequently, there may be two payments received in the first year.  \\nIf the participant fails to receive an annual minimum required distribution during the required time frame, the individual may incur a tax penalty equal to 50% of the amount that should have been distributed.  \\nBeginning in 1997, active participants in 401(k) plans who are over age 70 ½ can delay commencement of MRDs until the later of retirement or separation from service. \\nNote, this does not apply to IRA participants or 401(k) plan participants who own 5% or more of the company. The IRS requires them to begin receiving MRDs at age 70 ½.  \\nThe MRD calculation is based on the participant‟s life expectancy, or the joint life expectancies of the participant and designated beneficiary based on actuarial tables set forth by the IRS. \\n Taxation of 70 ½ Minimum Required Distributions \\nThe mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding does not apply to MRDs. Instead, the recipient is required to make a federal income tax withholding election on IRS Form W-4P. In some cases, if the participant fails to make a withholding election before the annual payment is made, the plan withholds federal income tax based on a default election. An MRD is not eligible for rollover. Participants can no longer defer paying taxes on this money once the MRD has been paid to them.\\n\\nDesired Output Length: in short(approx: 50 words based on the context)\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Query: What is Ghibli\"}]}', NULL, '<error>ERROR_CODE:NO_RELEVANT_ANSWER</error>\n<h1>What is Ghibli?</h1>\n<main>\n  <p>Sorry, No relevant answer found.</p>\n</main>', '2025-04-02 11:13:32.842229');

Some benefit plans, such as health insurance and dental insurance, provide for their immediate well being. Other benefit plans promise to provide financial security at retirement. There are a number of ways employers provide retirement benefits for their employees. Most employers will use defined benefit, or pension plans, and/or defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits. The most common type of defined contribution plan is the 401(k) plan.  \\nEmployers have various methods of providing retirement benefits for their employees. Today, more and more employers are asking their employees to share in the responsibility for their retirement. One of the ways employers ask employees to share the cost is through a 401(k) retirement plan. Employees can save for their retirement and also provide an immediate tax savings for themselves and their employer by participating in a 401(k) plan. A 401(k) plan participant decides, within plan limits: how much to contribute, where to invest the contributions, and how long the contributions remain in the plan.  \\nHighly Compensated Employees  \\nUnder ERISA guidelines for plan qualification, a plan may not discriminate in favor of any particular group of employees, such as highly compensated employees (HOEs). Employees are considered highly compensated if:  \\n \\nThey own 5% or more of the company, or  \\nThey have earned $90,000 or more during the previous year (effective for year 2003). For 2004, the amount will remain at $90,000. \\nQualified Plan \\nQualified plans are plans that meet strict IRS requirements. 401(k) plans are a type of qualified plan \\n \\n\\n\\n2.2 Types of Plan \\nOverview \\nEmployers who provide employees with a retirement benefit have a choice whether to use the defined benefit (DB) plan design, commonly called a pension plan or the defined contribution (DC) plan design. For many years the DB plan was the primary method used by employers to provide a retirement benefit. In recent years, employers have turned to a popular DC plan method known as a 401(k) plan. \\nSome employers offer both types of plans while others offer neither. However, most employers elect to offer at least one type of plan to receive the immediate tax & retirement benefit.  \\nDefined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution \\nDefined benefit pension plans and defined contribution savings plans are both designed to provide the employee with retirement income. Some of the common differences between the DB and DC plans are listed in the following chart.  \\n\\t \\tDefined Benefit Plan \\tDefined Contribution Plan \\nThe employer funds it. \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\tEmployee and employer contributions are allocated to individual participants. The participant may have to contribute to receive a benefit. \\nThe employer bears the investment risk. \\t \\t \\t \\tThe participant bears the investment risk. \\nIt is generally difficult to communicate.  \\t \\t \\t \\tIt is easier to communicate.  \\nThere is a definite benefit formula. \\t \\t \\t \\tThe final retirement benefit is unknown. \\nThe benefit is expressed as an annuity  payable at normal retirement age, usually  age 65.  \\t \\tThe benefit is expressed as an account balance. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nThe following plans are designated as defined contribution plans:  \\n401(k) plans \\nProfit sharing plans  \\nThrift plans  \\n403(b) and 457 plans  \\nEmployee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)  \\n \\nThe 401(k) plan is the most popular form of defined contribution plan used by employers today.  \\n \\n2.3 Eligibility  \\nOverview \\nWhen an employer decides to offer a 401(k) plan, it must determine, within ERISA guidelines who will be permitted to participate and how eligibility will be defined. Although ERISA dictates many of the parameters plans must follow it also gives employers some choices when setting eligibility requirements for 401(k) plan participation  \\nEmployers may choose to limit eligibility based on:  \\nAge:  Under ERISA, a plan may limit participation to employees age 21 and over. Plans may choose to allow participation before age 21. \\nService: The maximum service requirement a 401(k) plan can impose for eligibility to participate, by law, is one year. A plan may choose to impose a service requirement as a cost savings measure, especially in industries where there is high turnover in the first year of employment.  \\nNote: DC plans other than 401(k) plans may require two years of service for             eligibility; however, employees entering the plan after two years must be 100% vested immediately upon entering the plan.      \\nEmployment classification:  Employers may choose to only allow full-time and/or permanent employees to participate, thereby excluding part-time and/or temporary employees. \\nNo eligibility requirements: Some plans may choose to have no eligibility restrictions. In this case, all employees would have the option to begin participating immediately upon hire.  \\nService:  If an employer chooses to impose a service requirement, the plan must decide how it will calculate one year of service. ERISA allows a number of methods for calculating when one year of service has been completed including:  \\n \\n \\n                                                    \\n                                                    \\n2\\n \\nC3    -Protected \\t \\tPage 2 of 169 \\nUn-controlled when printed \\n \\n\\n1,000 Hours Method \\tElapsed Time Method \\nThe most common method is to determine if the employee has completed at least 1,000 hours of service in the 12-month period following the date of hire. \\tThis option does not count hours, only the specific length of service, such as one year from the date of hire. \\n\\n \\nEntry Dates \\nERISA allows employers to establish specific times of the year when employees can enroll in 401(k) plans. These are called entry dates. The designated enrollment dates may be quarterly, monthly, or by payroll cycle. Entry dates relieve plans from the possible administrative task of enrolling new participants on a daily basis.  \\nERISA requires that the use of entry dates may not delay entry into the plan by more than six months after the employee has met the plan‟s eligibility requirements. \\n \\n2.4 Contribution \\n401(k) plans offer employers opportunities for flexible plan design within the requirements established by (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and the Department of Labor (DOL).  401 (k) plans may be offered in several different ways with several different contribution options. Some 401(k) plans have employee contributions only and others have both employee and employer contributions. 401(k) plans may have only before-tax contributions or they may have both before- and after-tax contributions.  \\nEmployee Contributions \\nInternal Revenue Code section 401 (a) (17) limits the annual amount of pay a qualified plan may consider in calculating tax-deferred contributions or benefits. This is known as the Maximum Compensation Limit, which limits the amount of pay that is eligible for all contributions. The limit for 2004 is $205,000.  \\nThis means that an employee who earns over this amount annually will be recognized as only earning $205,000 for 401(k) plan purposes. The limit is periodically adjusted by the IRS to reflect changes in the cost of living index. \\nEmployee Before-Tax Contributions \\nDeductions taken from the employee‟s paycheck on a before-tax basis are applied before taxes are taken out of the employee‟s gross income. Only Social Security and Medicare taxes are deducted prior to any before-tax contributions. Before-tax contributions reduce the participant‟s current taxable income. Before-tax contributions are also commonly referred to as pre-tax. \\nEmployee After - Tax Contributions \\nDeductions taken from the employee‟s paycheck on an after-tax basis are applied after all taxes have been taken out of the employee‟s gross income. After-tax contributions are also commonly referred to as post-tax. \\n \\nEmployer Contributions  \\nIn addition to employees making contributions, some employers make contributions on behalf of the employees. Employers may choose to provide these contributions to encourage employee participation in the 401(k) plan and/or attract and retain skilled employees. Employer contributions are considered before-tax contributions and remain tax deferred until withdrawn. Some employers may choose to provide: \\nA matching contribution based on the contributions the participant makes ;  \\nContributions based on the annual profits of the company; \\nBoth types of employer contributions; and  Neither type of employer contributions. \\nEmployer Matching Contributions  \\nMatching contributions are usually a percentage of the participant‟s compensation and are tied to the amount the participant contributes.  \\nEmployers frequently place a limit on the amount of the match. Only employees who have chosen to contribute to the 401(k) plan receive matching contributions.  \\nEmployer Discretionary Contributions \\nDiscretionary contributions can be provided in addition to, or instead of, employer matching contributions. One example of a discretionary contribution is a profit sharing contribution. \\nDiscretionary contributions may change each year and are generally tied to annual profits. \\n\\tEmployers \\tmay \\toffer \\tdiscretionary \\tcontributions \\tone \\tyear \\tand \\tnone \\tthe \\tnext. \\nDiscretionary contributions are made on behalf of all eligible employees even if they choose not to contribute to the 401(k) plan \\n \\n \\n \\n2.5 Vesting \\n\\t2.5.1 \\tOverview  \\nVesting refers to the ownership in all or a portion of the company’s matching contributions or discretionary contributions and the earnings on these contributions. A participant is always 100% vested in employee and rollover contributions and the earnings on those contributions. Employer contributions such as matching or discretionary contributions may be subject to a vesting schedule. \\n\\t2.5.2 \\tVesting Credit  \\nA participant gains ownership of employer contributions and the earnings associated with those contributions according to a schedule referred to as Vesting Schedule, Under ERISA, an employer generally must give credit for a year of vesting for any year in which the employee worked 1,000 hours or more. \\nEmployers may also determine vesting based on elapsed time. Elapsed time does not count hours. An employee receives vesting credit after completing a specific length of service.  \\nERISA provides minimum standards for two types of vesting schedules: cliff and graded. \\nHowever, 401(k) plans may choose to be more generous than the ERISA requirements.  \\nCliff Vesting Schedule \\nIn a cliff vesting schedule, the participant becomes fully vested in the employer contributions and associated earnings after a certain period of time. No partial vesting occurs. For employer contributions for plan years beginning n 2002, a participant must be fully vested after completing three years of vesting service. \\n \\nERISA MINIMUM - CLIFF SCHEDULE \\nYears of Service  \\tVesting %  \\nLess than 3 years  \\t0%  \\n3 years or more  \\t100%  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nGraded Vesting Schedule  \\nIn a graded vesting schedule, the participant becomes vested in the employer contributions and associated earnings gradually over a period of time. For plan years beginning in 2002, ERISA requires that a participant must be fully vested after six years of vesting service. The participant must be at least 20% vested after two years, 40% after three years, 60% after four years, 80% vested after five years of vesting service, and 100% after six years of vesting service.  \\nA plan may be more generous and offer a two-year cliff, for example. \\n\\nERISA MINIMUM - GRADED SCHEDULE  \\nYears of Service  \\tVesting %  \\nLess than 2 years  \\t0%  \\n2 years  \\t20%  \\n3 years  \\t40%  \\n4 years  \\t60%  \\n5 years  \\t80%  \\n6 years  \\t100%  \\n\\n \\nA plan may be more generous and offer a four-year graded schedule, for example, where the participant is fully vested after four years of vesting service. \\n \\n \\n2.6 Forfeitures \\nIf a participant leaves the company before being fully vested, the participant may forfeit all or a portion of the employer contributions and associated earnings. The Exclusive Benefit Rule states that forfeited amounts cannot be returned to the employer, but must be used for the plan‟s participants. The employer can either apply these forfeited amounts to reduce future employer contributions or reallocate forfeitures among the remaining plan participants.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.7 Account Activity  \\nPlan representatives and administrators have the ability to routinely process transactions for participants. They have access to each participant‟s account information to process requisitions to:  \\nChange contribution rates;  \\nChange future investment directions;  \\nMove existing balances from one fund to another; and   Respond to information requests.  \\nThese transactions are processed based on the plan‟s valuation cycle. Participants generally complete these types of transactions through an automated touch-tone phone system or a web site and then receive a confirmation statement. Participants may also contact a plan representative to assist them with the transaction.  \\nContribution Rate Changes  \\nWhen participants first enroll in a 401(k) plan, they must elect the amount they want to contribute to the plan. This amount is expressed as a percentage of eligible compensation. If the 40 1(k) plan permits before-tax and after-tax contributions, the participant elects how much will be contributed on a before-tax and/or after-tax basis.  \\nAfter the initial enrollment, participants may wish to change the percentage of compensation they contribute throughout the year. The plan may, however, limit the number of times a participant can make a change in any plan year. Contribution rate changes are typically processed. Only one or two times per month-usually based on the participant‟s payroll cycle.  \\nChanges cannot exceed plan limits. For example, a 401(k) plan may permit a NHCE participant to contribute between 1% and 15% of eligible compensation. The plan may restrict HCE participants to contribution elections between 1% and 8% of eligible compensation.  \\nInvestment Direction  \\nAn investment direction election determines where future contributions and loan repayments should be invested. Investment directions generally must be made in increments of 1% and must total 100%. A participant‟s investment strategy may change or the participant may want to respond to market changes, and therefore, redirect where the contributions are invested. The investment direction election has no effect on existing balances in the investment funds. \\nFund Transfers \\nFund transfers move balances directly from one investment fund to another investment fund to another investment fund or funds. The participant determines the percentages to be transferred. Participants may make this election through the automated touch-tone system, web site or plan representative.  \\nFund Reallocations  \\nFund reallocations (sometimes called balance reallocations) require the participant to indicate, in whole percentages, an amount for each of the investment choices. The participant may elect a zero percentage for some of the funds. Theoretically, it is as though the participant takes all the money in all the funds and holds it in her hands. She then has to decide, in whole percentages, where the money is to be invested. The total must equal 100%.  \\n2.8 Loans \\n Overview  \\nIf the plan has a loan provision, participants may borrow money from their 401(k) plan account. A plan loan is an agreement that allows participants to borrow from their account and repay the principal, with interest, back into the account, generally repaid through payroll deductions. If the loan is repaid on schedule, no tax liability is incurred; however, failure to repay will result in default of the loan and tax consequences to the participant.\\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) & Internal Revenue Service (IRS) imposes several plan loan restrictions to ensure that loan provisions are designed in a nondiscriminatory manner with regard to: \\nAvailability; \\nInterest rates; \\nThe security of the loan and  Administrative procedures.  \\nLoan amounts;  \\nThe duration of the loan; and  Taxes. \\nAlthough 401(k) plans are not required to offer loans, an employer may choose to offer one or both of the following loan: \\nGeneral purpose loan (also referred to as a general loan) \\nHome loan (also referred to as a primary residence loan)  \\nERISA imposes restrictions on the maximum duration of a loan. Typically, a general purpose loan must be repaid within 5 years. A home loan may be extended beyond the five years period (that is, 5, 10, 15 or 20 years or other period). If participant is refinancing a home loan, the new loan will need to be paid off within the original term of the loan.   \\n \\nThe IRS restricts maximum loan amounts. If the plan permits, a participant may have more than one loan outstanding. However, the maximum amount a participant may borrow at any one time is $50,000 of his vested account balance (VAB). Under ERISA, the VAB includes outstanding loan balances (OLBs).  \\n \\nThe amount a participant may borrow is determined by using the following formula:  \\nThe lesser of:  \\n1/2 (Vested Account Balance + Outstanding Loan Balance)-Outstanding Loan Balance  or  \\n$50,000 minus the highest Outstanding Loan Balance in the past 12 months  (The highest OLB can come from loans currently outstanding or loans that were  paid in full during the past 12 months.)  \\n \\nFor example, if a plan sets a minimum loan amount of $1 000, the participant‟s vested account balance must be at least $2000 with no outstanding loans. \\n \\nThe plan may restrict a particular type of contribution (for example, employer match) from being borrowed, yet allow those contributions to be included in the account balance recognized in the maximum loan amount calculation.  \\nThe amount available for a participant to borrow is based on the vested value of the account on the day he requests for the loan, since the loan is actually paid from the participant‟s account on the date it is processed. It is likely that the participant‟s vested account balance has changed. However, it is important to note that the 50% rule pertains to the vested account balance at the time of the request, not at the time the loan is processed. \\nLoan money comes from the before-tax money type, which includes:  \\nEmployee before-tax contributions;  \\nEmployer match;  \\nPrevious rollover monies; and  \\nThe earnings from these monies.  \\nIn some cases, after-tax contributions are also included. The plan determines the order of the money types used to provide loan. For example, some plans may require loan amounts to come from rollover money first, then employee before-tax contributions, then employer contributions, and last employee after-tax contributions. \\nLoan Repayments \\nParticipants must repay loans according to the terms agreed to under the plan, but no less frequently than quarterly. Generally, loan repayments are made through payroll deductions each pay period with after tax dollars. Exceptions may occur, however. A participant can be on unpaid leave, for example, and make payments from a personal check or electronic fund transfer, if the plan allows. An amortization schedule shows how the portion of each repayment applies to the outstanding interest and principal. \\nThe money is usually repaid according to the current investment direction elected by the participant and is repaid to its original money type even though it is deducted from the participants paycheck after taxes are taken out. Therefore the investment funds the loan is paid from will often not be the same investment funds to which repayment is made. However the repayment is made into the contribution type the loan money was taken from. \\nLoan Prepayments  \\nPrepayment of loans, in full, is generally permitted at any time. Some plans may permit partial prepayment. Procedure for prepayment varies from plan to plan. \\nDeemed Distribution \\nMost loans are repaid by deductions from the employee‟s paycheck. Generally, when a participant with an outstanding loan goes on unpaid leave, the loan can be repaid manually by check or electronic fund transfer. If an active participant does not make the required payments, the loan will be considered a deemed distribution after a fixed period of time, usually 90 days.  \\nParticipants who have a deemed distribution will receive an IRS Form 1099-R in January of the year following the year in which the deemed distribution occurred. Deemed distributions are not eligible for rollover to a qualified plan or IRA. \\nIf a participant has a loan that is considered to be a deemed distribution, and the loan has not been repaid, he will generally not be allowed to request a new loan until the deemed loan is paid back. As of January 1, 2004, some plans may allow their participants with an unpaid loan considered as a deemed distribution to request a new loan if the participant enters into a payroll withholding agreement or provides the plan with adequate security for the loan. This policy may not apply to all our clients‟ plans. In other words, this policy may vary from client to client. \\nSuspension of loan repayments during an active military leave of absence will NOT cause the loan to be deemed distributed, even if the leave exceeds a year. The loan must be fully repaid by the end of the original term plus the period of the active military service. .  \\nSeparating from Service with an Outstanding Loan Balance \\nIf the participant separates from service with an outstanding loan balance, most employers require that the loan be repaid, in full, within a specified period of time after separation. If the loan is not repaid within the specified time, it is defaulted and reported as a taxable distribution for the year in which it is defaulted. \\nTaxation of Defaulted Loans \\nFailure to repay a loan after separating from service, according to the terms of the plan results in default of the loan. If the loan is defaulted, the outstanding loan balance is considered a taxable distribution and is thus subject to federal (and state, if applicable) income tax withholding for the year of the distribution. The participant receives an IRS Form 1099-R for the outstanding loan balance in January following the year of default. If the participant defaults on the loan after separating from service, the outstanding loan balance is reported as taxable income. \\n \\n \\n2.9 Withdrawal \\nAlthough the primary purpose of a 401(k) plan is to help employees save for retirement, many plans allow participants to withdraw money from their 401(k) plan (MS accounts while actively employed. Employers are not required to make withdrawals from 401(k) plans available to their participants. Therefore, the plans of different employers are structured differently, with some being more restrictive in their withdrawal provisions than others. If in-service withdrawals are permitted from the plan, the money withdrawn from the account cannot be paid back and is subject to taxation if not rolled over. \\nActively employed participants can make these three main types of withdrawals from their plan accounts: \\n Regular or ordinary withdrawal;   Hardship withdrawal; and   Age 59½ withdrawal.  \\nEach type of withdrawal has specific Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and plan restrictions controlling the money types available for withdrawal and the order of their withdrawal. \\n \\n\\t2.9.1 \\tTaxation of In-Service Withdrawals \\nUnder current federal tax law, participants are not required to pay federal, and in most cases, state and local income tax on contributions and their earnings in a 401(k) plan as long as they remain in the plan. Generally, whenever money is withdrawn or distributed from a 401(k) plan it becomes subject to taxation. Taxation varies depending on the money type withdrawn and the reason for the withdrawal in general \\nThe withdrawal is subject to a 20% mandatory federal income tax withholding, if not rolled over. The amount of the mandatory withholding may be more or less than the amount the participant owes in federal income tax. A participants actual tax liability for the withdrawal will depend on the participants own tax situation for example exemptions household income deductions etc Withholding for state taxes may also be required. \\n \\nAmounts obtained from in-service withdrawals may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if the participant is under age 59 ½. The plan does not withhold for the 10% penalty tax at the time of distribution; participants pay the penalty when they file their taxes.  \\n \\nAn IRS Form 1099-R is mailed to the participant in January of the year following the year in which the withdrawal is taken. For example, for a withdrawal taken in March of 2003, the participant receives a 1099-R in January 2004. This form shows the total amount of the withdrawal, the amount subject to tax, and the amount of federal and state tax withheld and forwarded to the IRS and state agencies. \\n \\n\\t2.9.2 \\tRegular Withdrawal  \\n Overview \\nA regular or ordinary withdrawal has the same basic characteristics of all in- service withdrawals: \\nThey are generally available only to actively employed participants;  \\nThe plan sponsor chooses the money or contribution types available; and establishes a withdrawal hierarchy.  \\n Contribution Types Available \\nThe types of contributions and associated earnings available for a regular withdrawal are chosen by the plan sponsor and may include:  \\nAfter-tax;  \\nRollover; and \\nEmployer contributions.  \\nRegular withdrawals do not include participant before-tax contributions or the associated earnings. ESOP, PAYSOP and TRASOP money is usually available for in-service withdrawals. \\n \\n \\n\\t2.9.3 \\tHardship Withdrawal \\nOverview  \\nParticipants with immediate and heavy financial need and no reasonable access to money from elsewhere can withdraw certain contributions from their 401(k) plans. The plan administrator determines whether the participant fulfills Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and plan-imposed hardship withdrawal requirements. He reviews the withdrawal request and associated documents and makes the determination based either on the “facts and circumstances” of each case or adoption of the Internal Revenue Code “safe harbor” guidelines or a combination of both.  \\nIRS Requirements \\nIRS regulations provide a narrow definition of hardship: The hardship must be caused by the immediate and heavy financial needs of the participant for which other resources are not reasonably available.  \\nTo qualify for a hardship withdrawal, the participant‟s request must pass a two-part test.  \\nthe qualifying need exists; and.  \\nno other resources are reasonably available to meet the need.  \\n       To determine the “existence of need” employers may use one of two methods:  \\nlRS Safe Harbors \\nFacts and Circumstances  \\n \\n\\t2.9.4 \\tAge 59 ½ Withdrawal \\nOverview  \\nActive participants age 59 ½ and older may take in-service withdrawals from their 401(k) plans. At age 59 ½, 401(k) plan participants may have access to more of their account. \\nContribution Types Available \\nIf the 401(k) plan allows, the participant may withdraw vested amounts from all types of contributions within individual plan limits. All participant contributions and associated earnings, including before tax monies, are made available for withdrawal at age 59 ½ Depending on plan provisions, employer contributions may be restricted. \\n \\n \\n2.10 Rollover \\nIn-Bound Rollovers  \\nEmployees may also contribute to a 401(k) plan by rolling over contributions. In-bound rollovers from another qualified plan or conduit IRA. Employees who have contributions in another qualified plan, usually from another employer, may be allowed to roll over these contributions to the current employer‟s plan to continue deferring the contributions from taxes. Beginning with plan years after December 31, 2001, taxable money in an IRA can be rolled to a 401(k) plan without using a conduit IRA.  \\n \\nIn-bound rollovers into a qualified plan may only contain taxable contributions and earnings. Beginning in 2002, after-tax contributions can be rolled over. Prior to 2002, after-tax contributions could not be rolled over, though the earnings on after-tax contributions were eligible for rollover since they had never been taxed. If a qualified plan accepts rollover of after-tax contributions, it must agree to account for the after-tax contributions separately.  \\n \\n \\n In-Bound Rollover Procedures  \\nThere are no regulations stating that employers must accept in-bound rollover contributions into their qualified plans. As a result, employers may or may not allow in-bound rollovers. Plans are required, however, to offer rollovers-out to other plans.  \\nIf rollovers-in are permitted in the plan, the following general procedures may apply: \\nEmployers may require employees to be able to participate in the 401(k) plan before rollovers-in will be accepted.  \\nEmployees may need to complete an in-bound rollover-in request form. The form will ask for the desired investment direction for the amount rolled over. \\nEmployees must attach the check from the previous plan or IRA.  \\nEmployees may need to provide documentation verifying that the in-bound rollover came from a qualified plan or a conduit IRA. Examples of this documentation include: letter of determination or a distribution statement.  \\n \\nOut - Bound Rollovers  \\nAt the time of distribution, the participant has the option to continue to defer taxation by rolling over all or a portion of the eligible account balance into an Individual Retirement Account or another qualified plan A direct rollover allows the participant to move the eligible account balance directly from one qualified plan to another or to an IRA Eligible account balances rolled into an IRA can subsequently be rolled into a qualified plan if it has been held in a conduit IRA (def An IRA that contains only taxable money from a qualified employer retirement plan It is not commingled with other money). \\n \\nBeginning in 2002 taxable money in an IRA can be rolled to a 401(k) plan without being held in a conduit IRA .Amounts that are eligible to be rolled over include employee before tax contributions and earnings, employer contributions and earnings, rollovers and associated earnings and aftertax contributions and associated earnings. Because of EGTRRA, after tax contributions are now eligible for a rollover. If the entire eligible account balance is rolled over, there are no tax consequences. The account balance is simply moving from one tax-deferred vehicle to another. \\n \\nIf at the time of distribution, participants elect to have their account balance paid directly to them, 20% of the taxable distribution will be withheld for federal income tax withholding. Withholding for state taxes may be required. A rollover option still exists however. Participants may choose to open their own IRA or make a rollover contribution to their new employer‟s qualified plan within60 days of the distribution. Participants may add their own money to make up all or a portion of the entire 20% that was withheld.  \\n \\nThe withholding tax paid to the IRS will be combined with all other taxes paid by the participant for the year. Participants may be due a refund when they file their tax return at year-end. \\n \\n \\n2.11 Distribution \\n Overview  \\nShareholders may take final distributions, upon termination, from a stock fund in the form of shares or cash. In certain types of plans, the employer may be required to offer the distribution in the form of shares Upon distribution it is up to the participant to decide whether to take the shares or receive the value of the shares as cash instead. When a participant chooses a share distribution, fractional shares in a participant‟s account are paid in cash. \\nFor example, a participant elects to take a distribution in shares. At the time of the distribution, she has a dollar value in her account of $1,520. The shares are valued at $50 a share. She would receive 30 shares of stock (30 X $50 = $1,500) and $20 in cash. \\n Participants qualify for final distribution of their vested account balances when they: \\nSeparate from service (retirement or otherwise);  \\nQualify as disabled under the specific plan guidelines;  \\nDie, in which case the account balance can be distributed to their designated beneficiary. \\nFinal distributions can be paid in several ways. Some forms of payment are required while others are not. Forms of payment include:  \\nA lump sum payment;  \\nDeferred payment; \\nInstallments; and \\nAn annuity, although these are rare.  \\nWhen a participant dies, the beneficiary is entitled to payment of the account balance. If the participant is married at the time of death, the beneficiary would automatically be the spouse. If the spouse has signed a valid consent/waiver, the participant may name someone else as beneficiary to receive amounts in the 401(k) plan after the participant‟s death. Spousal beneficiaries have the option to defer distribution until the participant would have been 70Y2. Non-spousal beneficiaries must receive a distribution no later than five years after the participant‟s death. The employer decides which payment options, besides those legally required, are offered by the plan. \\n\\t2.11.1 \\tFinal Distribution Requirements \\nWhen a participant retires, leaves the company, or becomes disabled the participant can elect to: \\nReceive a distribution, or \\nLeave the money in the plan until a later date (defer the payment)  provided the vested account balance is greater than the plan‟s cash out  level (see below). \\nIf the participant leaves the account balance in the plan:  \\nTaxes will continue to be deferred until the participant receives the  money.  \\nThe balance of the account that remains in the plan will share in gains  or losses of the investment funds.  \\nInvestment changes may be made according to the rules of the  individual plan.  \\nThe participant can request a final distribution at any time in the future.  \\nThe forms of payment for final distribution must include a lump sum payment option; however, the plan sponsor does have some discretion. For example, the plan sponsor may or may not offer installment and/or annuity payments.  \\n \\nCash out Amounts \\nWhen participants request a final distribution, they receive a distribution package, which explains payment options as well as the rollover option. For administrative convenience, ERISA permits 401(k) plan balances at or below a certain level, referred to as the cash out amount, to be paid out after separation from service of employment without the participant‟s consent. The current threshold is a vested account balance of $5,000 or less. Plan sponsors have the choice to implement this option.  \\nIf the vested account balance is greater than $5,000, IRC regulations require the participant‟s consent before making a lump sum distribution. Without the participant‟s consent, the distribution will be deferred.  \\nIf the vested account balance is $5,000 or less, then the lump sum payment may be distributed without the participant‟s consent. The participant must be given an opportunity to elect a direct rollover of the eligible account balance.  \\nPayment Options  \\nIf participants choose to receive a distribution from the plan, they may be able to choose from various payment options, which may include:  \\nLump sum paid to the participant - the participant‟s vested account balance is distributed to the participant. The plan administrator automatically deducts the mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding from the distribution. The distribution may also be subject to the 10% penalty tax if the participant is under the age of 59 ½ and not otherwise exempt. Withholding for state taxes may also be required. \\n \\nLump sum rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA - the participant‟s vested account balance is distributed to the qualified plan or IRA. There is no federal income tax withholding. \\nInstallment - a specific number of payments of approximately equal value. The payment amount is calculated based on the number of payments requested. An example of an installment payment option would be a provision, which allows participants to elect up to 20 annual installments. Installment payments of ten years or less are eligible to be rolled over.  \\nAnnuity - a series of regular payments, guaranteed to continue for a specific time, usually the participant‟s lifetime. The payment amount is calculated based on the life expectancy of the participant or the participant and the joint beneficiary (using IRS actuarial tables). Annuities are rare in 401(k) plans.  \\n \\nIf the participant defers payment, the participant may come back at any time and request a distribution. The ability of a participant to leave money in the 401(k) plan account depends on whether it is above the cash out level ($5,000). If the balance of the account is above the cash out level, a participant cannot be forced to take a distribution. Ievel, a participant cannot be forced to take a distribution.  \\n Taxation of Final Distributions \\nAs with withdrawals, final distributions are subject to the mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding, and the 10% penalty tax if the participant is under age 59¼ and not otherwise exempt, unless the distribution is directly rolled over Withholding of state taxes may also be required.  \\nThe 10% penalty tax does not apply if the final distribution is made \\nAfter age 59 ½;  \\nBecause of separation from service at or after age 55 (separation includes leaving the company for any reason or retirement);  \\nPayable in the form of periodic payment;  \\nOn account of a QDRO; or \\nFor certain medical expenses (those that are deductible for income tax purpose; unreimbursed medical expenses must exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. \\n\\t2.11.2 \\tMinimum Required Distribution  \\nOverview  \\nAge 70 ½ minimum required distributions, more commonly known as, Minimum Required Distributions (MRDs), mandate certain 401(k) plan participants receive certain minimum payment from their account balances beginning at age 70 ½. MRDs apply to all qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans and pension plans. MRDs also apply to IRAs. \\nRequirements \\nThe IRC requires participants to begin receiving MRDs from a 401(k) plan no later than April 1 following the year in which the participant reaches age 70 ½. \\nMRDs are paid annually. The first payment must begin by April 1 of the year following the year in which the participant turns 70 ½ Subsequent distributions must be paid by December 31 of each year. Consequently, there may be two payments received in the first year.  \\nIf the participant fails to receive an annual minimum required distribution during the required time frame, the individual may incur a tax penalty equal to 50% of the amount that should have been distributed.  \\nBeginning in 1997, active participants in 401(k) plans who are over age 70 ½ can delay commencement of MRDs until the later of retirement or separation from service. \\nNote, this does not apply to IRA participants or 401(k) plan participants who own 5% or more of the company. The IRS requires them to begin receiving MRDs at age 70 ½.  \\nThe MRD calculation is based on the participant‟s life expectancy, or the joint life expectancies of the participant and designated beneficiary based on actuarial tables set forth by the IRS. \\n Taxation of 70 ½ Minimum Required Distributions \\nThe mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding does not apply to MRDs. Instead, the recipient is required to make a federal income tax withholding election on IRS Form W-4P. In some cases, if the participant fails to make a withholding election before the annual payment is made, the plan withholds federal income tax based on a default election. An MRD is not eligible for rollover. Participants can no longer defer paying taxes on this money once the MRD has been paid to them.\\n\\nDesired Output Length: in short(approx: 50 words based on the context)\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Query: What is retirement\"}]}', NULL, '<h1>What is retirement?</h1>\n<main>\n  <p>Retirement typically refers to the phase in life when an individual stops working full-time in their professional career.

Snake Bite 64\\r\\nThe National Rural Health Mission launched on 12th April 2005, seeks to\\r\\nprovide effective, efficient and affordable health care to rural population in\\r\\neighteen states with weak public health indicators.\\r\\nOne of the key components of the mission is creating a band of female health\\r\\nvolunteers, appropriately named “Accredited Social Health Activist” (ASHA) in\\r\\neach village within the identified States.  These ASHAs would act as a ‘bridge’\\r\\nbetween the rural people and health service outlets and would play a central\\r\\nrole, in achieving national health and population policy goals.\\r\\nASHAs are to be selected by community, out of residents within the community.\\r\\nThey would work on voluntary basis, although compensation would be provided\\r\\nto them for specific activities and services. ASHA guidelines clearly lay down\\r\\nthe accountability mechanisms. The induction training for ASHA would be\\r\\ncompleted in 23 days spread in five rounds over a period of 12 months to be\\r\\nfollowed by periodic re-training for about two days once every alternate month.\\r\\nEquipping ASHAs with knowledge and skills required to perform the assigned\\r\\nroles will be crucial element in the programme. The training programme for\\r\\nPreface\\r\\nASHAs needs to be organised closer to communities.  A major challenge will be\\r\\nto sustain the interest of selected women participating in the initial\\r\\ntraining programme.\\r\\nThis book is first in the series, to be made available during the entire training\\r\\nperiod. Written in simple language, it can be modified, adapted and translated\\r\\nby respective States as per their needs. The programme managers working in\\r\\nNGO settings may also like to use this book.\\r\\nI take this opportunity to thank United Nations Population Fund for providing\\r\\ntechnical assistance for development of the training materials to be used in\\r\\nASHA programme.\\r\\n30th June 2005\\r\\nPrasanna Hota\\r\\nSecretary, Health & Family Welfare\\r\\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare\\r\\nGovernment of India\\r\\nNew Delhi\\r\\n4 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nThe conceptualization, compilation, editing and production of the modular\\r\\nbooks to be used for pre-deployment and also on job-training of ASHAs; has\\r\\nbeen a collective effort for all. Nevertheless, the constant support and sustained\\r\\nguidance at all the states of the work, has been available from Shri. Prasanna\\r\\nHota, Secretary, Smt. S. Jalaja, Additional Secretary, Shri.

I wish to convey my sincere gratitude to\\r\\nthem for the same.\\r\\nThe contribution from the Department of AYUSH towards mainstreaming\\r\\nvarious popular remedies advocated for prevailing common ailments in Indian\\r\\ncommunities offers an excellent opportunity for the ASHAs to perform their\\r\\nduties efficiently; deserves commendations.\\r\\nProf. N.K. Sethi, Director, National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, along\\r\\nwith his senior faculty colleagues immensely contributed in enhancing the\\r\\neducational and technical quality of the work to the taste of ASHAs.\\r\\nDr. Shyam Astekar, Consultant and Dr. Dinesh Agarwal, Technical Adviser\\r\\n(Reproductive Health), UNFPA provided substantive assistance in preparation\\r\\nAcknowledgement\\r\\nof reading material for ASHA.

ASHAs\\r\\nafter taking up and completing this learning programme will be equipped with\\r\\nnecessary knowledge and skills to effectively perform the tasks and activities\\r\\nexpected from her.\\r\\nYou will have the learning programme completed during five exposures\\r\\nspread over the entire year and is to be completed during specified 23 days.\\r\\nEach ASHA will receive reference material in form of books during the\\r\\nlearning programme. \\r\\nThere are 19 themes to be covered in the 23 days learning programme. These\\r\\nare listed in the chart given in next page. Each theme has some lessons. Each\\r\\nlesson is complete by itself. We learn the 19 themes, lesson by lesson during\\r\\neach learning exposure. Some themes having few lessons only may not spread\\r\\nover all five learning exposures. The reading material specific to each lesson and\\r\\nthemes has been organized in the form of books. You have in your hands book\\r\\nno 1. Similarly books no. 2, 3, 4 and 5 will be available in the subsequent\\r\\nlearning exposures.\\r\\n2\\r\\nEach lesson is about 2-3 pages, and can be completed in half an hour. In\\r\\neach lesson, you have some knowledge bits, and some skills to learn. At the\\r\\nend there are some points to think about. Your facilitators will help and\\r\\nencourage you to find out the solutions of these issues. For skills, you will\\r\\nhave the opportunity of hands-on experience or demonstrations to\\r\\nbe organized by the facilitators. During the sessions, you can practice\\r\\nsome skills.\\r\\nSo after the first learning exposure of seven days, you will have acquired\\r\\npreliminary knowledge on most themes. You are supposed to take simple\\r\\nassessment after each exposure. These assessments will help in making\\r\\nappropriate changes if required.\\r\\nAfter completion of first exposure, you will be working in the village and\\r\\nalong with Nursedidi, the Anganwadi behen, Self Help Group (SHG)\\r\\nmembers and the male MPW worker. You will have some assignments to do\\r\\nin the village, like water disinfection, or attending the ANC clinic/health\\r\\nday. Your facilitators will give these assignments after each exposure.\\r\\nYou will keep record of assignments given to you and share in the\\r\\nnext exposure.\\r\\nThe book number 1 is simple enough to understand for even 4th-5th standard\\r\\neducated women. As we move on to the other books, lessons will be focused\\r\\non slightly complex issues. The learning programme is participatory. You learn,\\r\\nand your facilitators help you to learn. You should ask questions and seek\\r\\nsolutions to likely problems you may anticipate during your work in the village.\\r\\nin your work.\\r\\nOur best wishes are with you, to serve the village health care needs!\\r\\n4 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\n5INTRODUCTION: THE ASHA LEARNING PROGRAMME\\r\\nDISTRIBUTION OF LESSONS IN THE ASHA TRAINING BOOKS AS PER THEMES\\r\\nTHEMES BOOK 1 BOOK 2 BOOK 3 BOOK 4 BOOK 5\\r\\nIntroduction, roles, tasks 1.

You require participation\\r\\nof everyone—the people, the nurse, the anganwadi, the Dai, the schoolteachers\\r\\nand the village Panchayat. You also need the help of doctor. You will need to\\r\\nwork with all of them so that people remain healthy.\\r\\nVillage people are not as rich as city people. They have to face many difficulties.\\r\\nThey depend on land and farming. Some of them also work as wage labourers in\\r\\nnearby towns. In many villages, rearing cattle is a source of income. Most farmers\\r\\ndepend upon rains. Many work as artisans. They work hard to live their life.\\r\\nSome people are too poor. They are grouped as below poverty line (BPL) as per\\r\\nGovernment criteria. Often they come from scheduled castes, tribes and other\\r\\nmarginalized groups. Families belonging to BPL are eligible for special benefits\\r\\nunder government schemes. A village may have different settlements for\\r\\ndifferent castes.\\r\\nEveryone needs health care. Yet some groups of people are vulnerable to sickness.\\r\\nThe poor people, the women, the children and adolescents and old people need\\r\\nhealth care more often. Their health needs are not adequately met. They have\\r\\nlittle or no money. At times they have to take loans at very high interest rates to\\r\\n3\\r\\nget admission in hospitals or to buy medicines for their kids. Your role is to\\r\\nguide them to get good care in time and that is affordable.\\r\\nVillage people have a practical sense of solving problems with simple\\r\\nresources. Thus they should be involved in village health planning to assess\\r\\nhealth needs and also help in selecting appropriate solutions to address the\\r\\ncommon problems.\\r\\nSchools, fair price shops, water, electricity, seeds, fertilizers, credit, animal care,\\r\\nbus/jeep, roads, employment, forest produce, common grazing grounds, post-\\r\\noffice, haat—we need all these services in the village. Health care is just one\\r\\nmore. It is not isolated, but part of the whole life of the village. As ASHA, you\\r\\nshall do your best to help your own people in their struggle for health and share\\r\\njoys of life. People have expectations from you. In following pages, you will\\r\\nlearn about your specific tasks to be undertaken by you as ASHA.\\r\\nVillage Health Plan\\r\\nYou should participate in Village health planning and help nursedidi, anganwadi\\r\\nbehen, and Panchayat members. This will be the foundation of all health work\\r\\nin the village. Village health planning helps us to select important health issues\\r\\nand make a work plan to solve them. Everybody\'s participation is necessary.\\r\\nNGO workers, school teachers, representatives of self help groups will also help\\r\\nin micro planning. You should ensure that marginalized population groups such\\r\\nas Scheduled castes, tribes, minorities and women are adequately involved in\\r\\nthe planning process. When people participate in planning, they also help in\\r\\noffering solutions and carrying out the tasks.\\r\\nMost villages will have health and sanitation committee. The committee\\r\\nmembers take initiative for development of village health plans. Village health\\r\\nplanning needs some facilitators They bring people together, activate them to\\r\\nthink and plan with people, map out problems and encourage solutions.\\r\\nDepending on the availability some NGOs workers can provide facilitation.\\r\\nTeachers can also help you. You should work proactively with anganwadi behen\\r\\nand nurse Didi to decide on the venue and timings for the planning meeting.\\r\\nVillage health plans provide a framework for health related actions. Many\\r\\nactions lead to health. Village planning is a community approach to solve\\r\\nproblems. You will learn more about it in the subsequent exposures of our\\r\\nlearning programme.\\r\\n8 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nExample: Development of a plan for tackling sanitation problem in village\\r\\nLet village teachers, Nursedidi, Anganwadi behen, artisans, Panchayat members,\\r\\nNGO workers meet and form a core group. You will be one of the members of\\r\\nthis group.\\r\\nThis group should go around village observing village sanitation and other\\r\\nproblems. You may involve students in village rally so as to raise awareness of\\r\\nsanitation issues inform about time and venue of planning meeting. Songs and\\r\\nstreet plays also invite attention of people.\\r\\nThen gather in a central place open to all. Draw a village map on a big paper or\\r\\na wall. Ask people to draw their house in the map. Map waste water cesspools\\r\\nin village. Discuss about problems. The village planning may take 2-3 days also.\\r\\nAsk people sources of wastewater flowing in the street or in cesspools. Mark\\r\\nthe house with things like tamarind seeds, small stones etc. Mark houses having\\r\\nfever cases. The Nursedidi, and the Anganwadi behen and MPW will check the\\r\\nhouses. They will discuss about malaria with villagers and talk of solutions.\\r\\nThink of solutions to eliminate breeding sites for mosquitoes. You can handle\\r\\nmore problems in the same meeting. Think of handling problem of malnutrition\\r\\namongst children in your village and how such exercises can be useful.\\r\\nCommunication for health behaviour change\\r\\nHealth information and communication is more important than pills and\\r\\ninjections. Proper information and advice help people to avoid diseases and\\r\\nstay healthy.\\r\\nHealth information is a lasting asset. Currently villagers especially poor women,\\r\\nmen and adolescents do not have access to information on health issues. You\\r\\ncan fill this gap and act as a local resource on health issues. Availability of\\r\\ninformation will trigger changes in health promoting behaviours and adoption\\r\\nof healthy practices.\\r\\n\\u0002 We should select issues close to people’s hearts and needs. Attend to more\\r\\nimportant problems first.\\r\\n\\u0002 See what people already know and build on existing knowledge base.\\r\\n\\u0002 Understand the problems from their viewpoint also.\\r\\n\\u0002 Share health information with them and find possible actions.\\r\\n9ASHA: MY EIGHT TASKS\\r\\n\\u0002 Find effective ways of how people learn to change their ways.\\r\\n\\u0002 Use any of these occasions for BCC: group discussion, personal discussion,\\r\\ndemonstration, village meetings, clinic contacts, exhibition, camps, Self\\r\\nHelp Group (SHG) meetings, meetings of adolescents, religious gatherings,\\r\\nhaat-bazaar days etc.\\r\\n\\u0002 Use aids for BCC: Chitrakatha, flip charts, booklets, posters, prabhat pheris,\\r\\nsongs, models, puppet shows, street plays etc\\r\\n\\u0002 Look for innovative methods in communication. For instance, one voluntary\\r\\norganization painted all the bulls in the village with health slogans on the\\r\\ntraditional bail-puja day. The moving slogans stayed for weeks.\\r\\n\\u0002 Assess impact of BCC efforts. Has it changed how people think? Has\\r\\nit changed the way they do things? Has it improved utilization of\\r\\nhealth services?\\r\\n\\u0002 Enable people to change their behaviour such as construction of sanitary\\r\\nlatrines in their house.\\r\\nAnd remember all advice is good if you can follow it in similar situations. You\\r\\nwill learn more about BCC in this programme.\\r\\nLinkages with AWW, TBA, ANM, MPW\\r\\nDuring your work, you need support of other persons engaged in\\r\\nhealth related activities.\\r\\nIn the village, we have Anganwadi, the Dai and some other healers. We will\\r\\nlearn more about them soon.\\r\\nThe Anganwadi Worker (AWW)\\r\\nAnganwadi is for village children under six years. They get supplementary\\r\\nfeeds in Anganwadi Centre (AWC). AW behen weighs children regularly\\r\\nand keep growth cards. As ASHA, we can work with the AW behen\\r\\nand Nursedidi on child health activities, and assist her in organising\\r\\nfixed monthly “Health Day”. They also provide supplementary food for\\r\\nPregnant women.\\r\\nThe Village Dai\\r\\nThe village Dai helps in childbirth. She conducts childbirth and attends\\r\\nnewborn. She gets training and kit for clean childbirth from the Primary Health\\r\\nCentre/Sub Centre (PHC/SC).\\r\\n10 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nOther Healers\\r\\nThe Village Vaid uses herbal medicines. He may have some knowledge of herbs\\r\\nand some Ayurvedic remedies. Some cures may be good. Faith healers practice\\r\\ncures with help of mantras and mindtechniques. They are also called as\\r\\n“Bhopas”, “Ojhas” in some communities. People go to them for some types of\\r\\nillnesses. The advise given by them may be of doubtful nature.\\r\\nThe Nursedidi (ANM)\\r\\nThe Nursedidi is very important for all our work. She works from the health sub\\r\\ncenter. She visits 5-6 villages and hamlets in turns. Her work includes:\\r\\nimmunization, care of mother and child, childbirth, contraceptive services,\\r\\nsome medical aid etc.\\r\\nThe Swasthya Karmi (Male worker)\\r\\nHe also helps the Nursedidi in her work. He gives fever treatment, medicine\\r\\nfor TB and Malaria. He also helps in controlling outbreak of diseases in\\r\\nthe village.\\r\\nCounseling\\r\\nPeople often need help to find solutions to their health problems. Here are some\\r\\nhealth related issues you can offer help.\\r\\n\\u0002 Adolescent health\\r\\n\\u0002 Pregnancy and childbirth\\r\\n\\u0002 Abortion,\\r\\n\\u0002 Childlessness\\r\\n\\u0002 Child Health and nutrition\\r\\n\\u0002 Immunization\\r\\n\\u0002 Unmet needs of contraception\\r\\n\\u0002 Intimate problems like sexually transmitted infections/AIDS.\\r\\n\\u0002 Chronic ailments like cancers, TB, leprosy,\\r\\n\\u0002 Choosing simple health care options\\r\\nYes, you may not know these problems fully. But you can certainly help\\r\\npeople where to go. You may also explain them as what kinds of solutions are\\r\\navailable in a given situation. You may also follow up with them and find out\\r\\nhow they are using the help. If there are any problems, you can suggest\\r\\nalternative ways.\\r\\n11ASHA: MY EIGHT TASKS\\r\\nCounseling needs knowledge of the subject. Knowledge grows with time and\\r\\nmore reading and discussing. Counseling also needs skills about talking with\\r\\ndifferent persons—men and women, young and old etc., understanding their\\r\\nviewpoints. It calls for sensitivity and empathy.\\r\\nCounseling also needs motivating skills. Different problems involve different\\r\\nsolutions. Therefore motivating becomes necessary. We often do it in the\\r\\nfamily. This is how we arrive at a decision after weighing pros and cons of\\r\\nseveral alternatives.\\r\\nYou can also do effective counseling after some experience.\\r\\nEscorting patients to a hospital\\r\\nMany people need to go to a town or city hospital for higher care. They feel lost\\r\\nand helpless in such situations. Often, they face difficulties in such situations.\\r\\nAlso somebody from the family has to stay back to look after children and\\r\\ncattle, getting money, farm work etc. They often need you to accompany them.\\r\\nYou can ensure that needy people get the right help. You also can help in\\r\\ndeciding to go at the PHC, Community Health Centre (CHC) or the district\\r\\nhospital. If the CHC is far away, people may choose to go to other suitable\\r\\nprivate or trust hospital. In some emergency situations (like bleeding during or\\r\\nimmediately after birth) time is precious. Situations that need escorting are:\\r\\n\\u0002 Childbirth and immediately after childbirth, difficulties during pregnancy\\r\\nand childbirth.\\r\\n\\u0002 Abortion and bleeding\\r\\n\\u0002 A seriously sick child\\r\\n\\u0002 A very sick person, like brain malaria. Heat stroke\\r\\n\\u0002 Someone wants to know about his/her TB or suspect HIV\\r\\n\\u0002 Accidents like snake bite, burns, serious injury, poisoning, drowning\\r\\n\\u0002 Clients for accepting IUD or sterilization.\\r\\nYou need to have necessary information and skills.\\r\\nKnowledge about which hospital to take to. What is the distance?\\r\\nHelp family in decision-making. You need to decide with the family about\\r\\nwhere to go.\\r\\n12 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nArranging transport with help of the villagers\\r\\nSending message to the hospital. (Learn to use a telephone if available).\\r\\nEscorting helps\\r\\nGood and timely first aid and escorting can save lives and reduce harm. It also\\r\\nimproves your relation with the families and enhances your credibility in\\r\\nvillage. This will make your linkages with the hospital.\\r\\nPrimary medical care\\r\\nPeople need curative care for many health problems. We have to offer\\r\\nrelevant, effective primary medical care to the needy. Good primary medical\\r\\ncare helps to:\\r\\n\\u0002 Save time and money for families\\r\\n\\u0002 Reduce possible damage to health and life threatening complications\\r\\n\\u0002 Make easy many of your health tasks in the village people value your service\\r\\nYour role is:\\r\\n\\u0002 Treat all simple illnesses (like coughs and colds) with simple cures. Many\\r\\nhealth problems are simple in nature.\\r\\n\\u0002 Help in moderate illnesses (like diarrhea) and watch for early signs of\\r\\ndangers and refer if necessary.\\r\\n\\u0002 Facilitate early detection of early serious chronic illness (like TB and cancer)\\r\\nand refer. This is great help you can do.\\r\\n\\u0002 Ensure proper first aid in accidents before referral/escorting.\\r\\n\\u0002 Depot holder for common health care commodities\\r\\nHowever you should be careful for:\\r\\n\\u0002 Do only what you know surely. Ask for help when necessary\\r\\n\\u0002 Use only medicines and care advised in this programme\\r\\n\\u0002 Do not wait for cure for more than 2 days in any illness you are not sure of.\\r\\n\\u0002 Explain side effects of drugs you use.\\r\\n\\u0002 Explain possible risks in some illnesses (like childhood ARI).\\r\\n\\u0002 Keep drug stocks ready and safe, away from reach of children.\\r\\n13ASHA: MY EIGHT TASKS\\r\\nAct as Depot Holders\\r\\nShe will also act as deport holder for essential provisions being made available\\r\\nto every habitation like oral rehydration solution (ORS), Iron Folic Acid (IFA)\\r\\ntablets, Chloroquine, Dispozale Delivery kits (DDK), oral pills and condoms etc.\\r\\nA drug kit will be provided to you. Contents of the kits will be based on the\\r\\nrecommendations of the expert/technical advisory group set up by the\\r\\nGovernment of India include both AYUSG and Allopathic formulations.\\r\\nRecords and registration\\r\\n\\u0002 Register every birth/still birth with the gram Panchayat within 14 days.\\r\\n\\u0002 Register every death with the gram Panchayat in 7 days.\\r\\n\\u0002 Keep record of your work in ASHA register/diary.\\r\\n\\u0002 Keep a diary for noting your experiences, difficulties and thoughts.\\r\\n\\u0002 Tally your records with records at Anganwadi and sub center and meetings.\\r\\nIf you notice that number of girls borne in your village is much less than boys,\\r\\nbe alert as it may be due to the “Sex Selective Abortions”. You will learn later\\r\\nas what will be your role in preventing sex selection of fetus.\\r\\nIn case of unusual occurrence of any disease in your village, you need to inform\\r\\nconcerned health authority i.e. In charge of local PHC.\\r\\n14 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nStaying Healthy\\r\\nA saying on health\\r\\nPehla such Nirogi Kaya is one of the saying. It means healthy body is the most\\r\\nimportant pleasure of life.\\r\\nGood health leads to productive, happy, and a long life. Both\\r\\nthe body and mind need to be healthy. And our relation with\\r\\nthe society should also be healthy. People often think health\\r\\nis linked to medicines, doctors and hospitals only. This is not\\r\\nalways true.\\r\\nHospitals and doctors are necessary when we fall sick. But\\r\\nfirst we need to take care of our body. You can prevent\\r\\ndiseases, promote health and prolong life.\\r\\nWe say Aarogyam dhansampada. This means health is real wealth. Health\\r\\nmakes us more productive, and ill health causes losses. Ill health keeps us\\r\\naway from work and livelihood. Ill health means spending on doctors and\\r\\nmedicines. In villages, people often take loans or sell goats and cattle to\\r\\npay for hospital expenses. The money people spend on tobacco and liquor\\r\\nalso causes ill health. Following health practices protect our wealth and\\r\\nincrease productivity.\\r\\n4\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nWhat is health?\\r\\nWhat make us healthy?\\r\\nWhat leads to ill health?\\r\\nHow health and ill health\\r\\nassessed?\\r\\nHow to remain healthy?\\r\\nSome parental gifts make part of one’s health. Like body features, frame, height,\\r\\nweight, looks, skin and color, some mental traits etc. Sometimes we even get\\r\\nsome health problems linked to parental gifts. We\\r\\ncan avoid marriage among blood relatives to\\r\\navoid some of these inborn defects.\\r\\nMany social and economic factors\\r\\nalso cause ill health. Poverty is the\\r\\nroot cause of many sicknesses. Low\\r\\npurchasing power limits access to\\r\\nadequate amount of food and\\r\\nbalanced diet. Women suffer from\\r\\nsicknesses during the process of giving\\r\\nbirth to a baby.\\r\\nAlso health care utilization is impacted adversely on account of poverty.\\r\\nIgnorance also contributes to sickness. Certain traditional practice are\\r\\nharmful. You should try to know about these traditional practices in\\r\\nyour village.\\r\\nA lot of health depends upon factors like\\r\\n\\u0002 Clean drinking water, clean air\\r\\n\\u0002 Balanced diet,\\r\\n\\u0002 Healthy personal habits,\\r\\n\\u0002 Healthy home and surroundings\\r\\n\\u0002 Healthy working conditions.\\r\\n\\u0002 Supportive family, friends and society\\r\\n\\u0002 Staying away from vices like alcohol, tobacco, multiple partners etc.\\r\\nTimely use of health services like immunization, birth spacing, mosquito bed\\r\\nnets etc is also necessary for health. If we fall ill, seeking treatment early is\\r\\nvery important in several illnesses. Examples are TB, cancer, high blood\\r\\npressure, pneumonia, snake bite etc. Late action may harm. Every hour\\r\\ncounts in such situations.\\r\\nTo stay healthy, we need to adopt healthy practices, and use health services in time.\\r\\n16 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nHow to assess health and ill health\\r\\nWe often say that one looks healthier than someone else. Healthiness shows up\\r\\nin happiness. But we often use ‘measures’ for health.\\r\\nWhen selecting young men/women for police or army, parameters such as\\r\\nheight, weight, chest circumference etc are used. We also use several tests\\r\\n(eyes, blood, urine etc) to test assess health of an individual.\\r\\nWe can talk of ill health in similar ways. We relate ill health to illnesses—cough,\\r\\nfever, diarrhea, TB, polio, drunkenness etc. At the level of community we use\\r\\nsimilar words. For instance, we say there are more people having fever this year\\r\\nthan the last year, or fewer people with diarrhea or no case of AIDS in this\\r\\nvillage. Or more infants dying in this village as compared to other village.\\r\\nSome examples of how we discuss health and ill health in the village:\\r\\n\\u0002 This year we have more/fewer fevers in the village.\\r\\n\\u0002 How many TB patients in the village?\\r\\n\\u0002 Mother and Child deaths in the village in last year.\\r\\n\\u0002 Number of underweight babies in the village.\\r\\n\\u0002 Number of teenage girls giving birth to babies.\\r\\n\\u0002 Number of smokers and alcoholics in village.\\r\\n\\u0002 Mental attributes-are people happy, number of suicides etc.\\r\\nYou can make our own checklist based on our situation and needs. A\\r\\ncomparison tells us if our village has better health than the last year or the\\r\\nnext village.\\r\\nThink about:\\r\\n\\u0002 Why people have to take loan for getting treatment in hospitals?\\r\\n\\u0002 Why women feel hesitant to talk about their health problems with\\r\\nmale doctors?\\r\\n\\u0002 Why people keep on waiting for days and months for seeking treatment?\\r\\n17STAYING HEALTHY\\r\\nCleanliness and health\\r\\nCleanliness is next to Godliness. Many illnesses spread due to\\r\\nlack of cleanliness. Illnesses like diarrhea, dysentery, cholera,\\r\\nworms, typhoid, skin infections, louse infestations and dental\\r\\nproblems etc are examples\\r\\nPersonal Hygiene\\r\\n5\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nImportance of personal\\r\\ncleanliness viz. hand\\r\\nwashing, cleaning teeth,\\r\\nnail cutting, daily bath,\\r\\nclean clothes, footwear,\\r\\nhair-care.\\r\\n19PERSONAL HYGIENE\\r\\nToilet practices\\r\\nIn India many people go to open fields for defecation. You need to help them\\r\\nin getting sanitary latrines installed. These are convenient for young girls,\\r\\nwomen, aged, sick person and children who often find it difficult to go to\\r\\nfields. You will get more information about construction of sanitary latrines\\r\\nfrom the block Panchayat office. After defecation, most use water-wash for\\r\\nanal clean up. This soils the hand with germs. It is necessary to wash the hands\\r\\nthoroughly after this, with soap or ash. Some people use paper or leaves of\\r\\nsome trees for anal clean up. This may be actually healthier as avoids soiling\\r\\nof hands with germs.\\r\\nHand wash\\r\\nMany diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid etc are caused due to germs present\\r\\non dirty hands. You should ensure that your hands are clean, especially before\\r\\neating any food. Wash your hands with plain water first and then with soap and\\r\\nsee the difference in wash water. You will appreciate the difference. After going\\r\\nto the toilet and before having meal, we must wash our hands thoroughly.\\r\\nWash the hands with a lot of water first. Apply soap or ashes and rub on the\\r\\nhands particularly the nails, tip of the fingers and between them. Again, pour\\r\\nwater. Dry it with a clean piece of cloth or napkin.\\r\\nCutting nails regularly removes space for collection of dirt. Long nails may be\\r\\nfashionable but also hide germs, if not properly cleaned.\\r\\nOur Mouth and teeth\\r\\nOur teeth remain healthy if we clean them everyday. Food particles collect in\\r\\nthe tooth gaps. This leads to tooth problems and swollen gums.\\r\\nWe must have a good mouthwash after each meal. This will remove food\\r\\nparticles and prevent the problems of tooth and gums. Just imagine what\\r\\nhappens to a utensil, which was used for cooking food last night and not\\r\\ncleaned overnight. It stinks badly. Similarly if we don’t clean our mouth after\\r\\nmeals it will also stink. Never have a bed-tea without mouthwash.\\r\\nDiscourage use of raw or burnt tobacco for cleaning teeth. That causes stains.\\r\\nSmoking also makes teeth dirty.\\r\\nUse of ash is good, but it cannot clean the gaps.\\r\\nRegular tooth brushing will remove the plaque\\r\\nUse a soft bristled brush. Be sure it is the right size (a smaller is better than a\\r\\nbig one).\\r\\nPlace the brush angled to the teeth. Brush the teeth toward the gums. Brush\\r\\nvery gently so that any plaque growing under the gum will be removed. Brush\\r\\nthe outside, the tongue side and the chewing surfaces of your teeth. Brushing\\r\\ntongue will make your breath odorless. Stale food and germs can collect on\\r\\nyour tongue and cause bad breath. Brush at least twice every day, before and\\r\\nafter sleep. This would prevent plaque formation.\\r\\nBrushing too vigorously or using a hard brush may cause damage to gums.\\r\\nChange the brush if the bristles look spread. A worn out toothbrush will not\\r\\nclean our teeth.\\r\\nToothpaste is not always necessary for brushing. Therefore brushing is a cheap\\r\\nway to keep the teeth and gums healthy.\\r\\nDatoun\\r\\nPeople in the village often use datoun, a 8-10 inches long and small finger thick\\r\\ntwig of neem, babool or Karanj etc. This practice is good. After chewing the\\r\\ntwig a bit, the end becomes bristly. The bristles can clean gaps between teeth.\\r\\nThe medicinal properties of datoun keep the gums healthy. Datoun should not\\r\\n20 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nne used if there are any ulcers in the mouth. Gargles with lukewarm water are\\r\\ngood for mouthwash after meals and particulars after eating sweet foods.\\r\\nDaily bath\\r\\nOur culture regards daily bath as a ritual. It is indeed necessary in hot weather\\r\\nas sweating makes us dirty. (In very cold regions one may skip daily baths.) Use\\r\\nwater economically. Some people like hot water. Massage with warm sesame\\r\\nor mustard oil is good before bath. Temperature of bath water should be neither\\r\\ntoo hot not too cold. After retiring from daily work, we should wash feet, hands\\r\\nand face with water to remove dirt and sweat.\\r\\nClean cloth\\r\\nClothes with comfortable fitting be used according to season. Cotton clothes of\\r\\nlight colour are more comfortable in summers and warm clothes in winters. Our\\r\\nundergarments and other clothes must be clean to keep away skin infections\\r\\nand louse infestation. A daily change is healthy practice.\\r\\nHair care\\r\\nCombing the hair everyday is necessary for its health. A head-bath is necessary\\r\\nespecially if your hair stinks due to sweating. Mixture of Shikakai, Reetha and Amla\\r\\nsoaked in water is a simple, cheap and safe way for washing oily and sticky hair. For\\r\\nlouse, we need fine combs. Avoid using somebody else’s comb as it may have louse.\\r\\nFootwear\\r\\nProper footwear is necessary to keep away germs and worms in the dust from\\r\\ngetting onto your feet. Many people walk or children play barefooted in the\\r\\nfields. Sometimes these fields are also used for defecation. The worms present\\r\\nin the faeces may get entry in the body when we walk bare footed. You will\\r\\nlearn more about these worms in subsequent books. Dusty and hot weather also\\r\\ncracks our soles. Some people buy shoes, only to use them during festivals or\\r\\nwhen going out to meet their friends and relatives. This is not good. The Indian\\r\\ncustom of keeping footwear outside the house is good. Everyone including\\r\\nchildren should always wear shoes when going outside their houses. Shoes are\\r\\nnecessary for those who get cracked heal.\\r\\nWhat do you think?\\r\\n\\u0002 Long nails come handy when some one is attacking you physically.\\r\\n\\u0002 One can remove food particles in between teeth by needles.\\r\\n\\u0002 Lack of privacy for bath is a cause of skin illnesses.\\r\\n21PERSONAL HYGIENE\\r\\nWater Safety\\r\\nAt Home\\r\\nImportance of water in health\\r\\nWater constitute about two third of human\\r\\nbody. A child’s body has some more water\\r\\nthan old people.\\r\\nWater is life\\r\\nindeed. Water\\r\\ndelivers oxygen and nutrients to different parts\\r\\nof body and removes toxins and wastes. Our\\r\\nancestors have taught us to worship water\\r\\nsources in the village. Good water is god. But\\r\\ndirty water can be demon.\\r\\nMany illnesses come from consumption of dirty\\r\\nwater. Diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, jaundice etc\\r\\nare some such illnesses. Half of illnesses can be due\\r\\nto dirty water.\\r\\nHow water becomes unsafe\\r\\nWater becomes bad when disease-causing germs mix in. Germs come from\\r\\nhuman and animal excreta. Even minute quantities of excreta can make water\\r\\nunsafe. You may say that water appears to be clean but there may be deadly germs\\r\\n6\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nHow water is important for\\r\\nhuman health?\\r\\nHow water becomes unsafe\\r\\nfor drinking?\\r\\nHow to make it safe at\\r\\nhome?\\r\\ninside not visible with naked eyes. So rivers and streams get germs once they pass\\r\\nthrough human settlements. Water from shallow wells, ponds is also contaminated\\r\\nwith germs. Human activity in vicinity of water sources make these water\\r\\nreservoirs contaminated.\\r\\nHow to make safe water at home\\r\\nUse only safe sources - a clean hand pump or covered sanitary well or piped\\r\\nwater supply. Fetch the water at evening and keep it covered and still overnight.\\r\\nStale water is safe at least for two days.\\r\\nIf necessary strain the water in a fold of cloth. It will remove bigger particles\\r\\nand some insects. Use a clean dhoti or sari.\\r\\nFor any turbid water, use alum to settle dirt. For this just dip alum in the water\\r\\nfor 2-3 rounds and then keep away.\\r\\nDo not dip hands in the water container. Remember your hands may be dirty.\\r\\nChildren are often in habit of taking water from vessel by dipping their hands\\r\\nespecially after play. Use a ladle (handle-cup) instead.\\r\\nWe can also make water safer by boiling\\r\\nit for about 15-20 minutes after the\\r\\nrolling starts.\\r\\nChlorine addition is just one way of\\r\\nmaking water safe. Overnight storage\\r\\nof water makes it practically safe.\\r\\nBoiling is good, but also needs fuel.\\r\\nIf you have chlorine drops, add 2 drops in\\r\\none bucket. Use this water after keeping\\r\\nhalf hour. If you have no chlorine drops, we can\\r\\nmake a stock solution from bleaching powder.\\r\\nTake one liter water in a jar. Add a teaspoonful of well-kept\\r\\nbleaching powder to it. Usually bleaching powder is available with\\r\\nMPW or Nursedidi. Stir it well and keep it still for five minutes. Pour the\\r\\nsolution into a plastic bottle using a strainer. Keep off the un-dissolved\\r\\npowder. Cap the bottle and you can use it for 2 days. Take 5 ml (in a big\\r\\n23WATER SAFETY AT HOME\\r\\nspoon) and add to one bucket of water and\\r\\nstir it well. Use the water after half an\\r\\nhour. Keep the stock solution well\\r\\ncapped. Otherwise the chlorine gas\\r\\nescapes making it useless. All\\r\\nfamilies in neighbourhood can use\\r\\nfrom same stock solution. In times\\r\\nof outbreaks of water borne\\r\\ndiseases, every family should take\\r\\nextra care. Never drink water you are\\r\\nnot sure of. Water safety is possible at\\r\\nhome, and at the village also.\\r\\nSome people say so! What do you think?\\r\\n\\u0002 Running water is safe and pure. There is no need to make it safe.\\r\\n\\u0002 Stale water should be thrown and fresh filled.\\r\\n\\u0002 Hand pump water is always safe.\\r\\n\\u0002 Chlorine gives a strong smell to water, so people do not like it.\\r\\n24 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nDisposal of \\r\\nWaste Water\\r\\nWaste water an asset, not a health hazard\\r\\nPools and streams of wastewater are common scene in a village. Nobody\\r\\nlikes it. This dirty wastewater is from our baths, kitchens and cattle-\\r\\nshades. Mosquitoes breed in such stagnated pools. They give us sleepless\\r\\nnights and malaria fever. Many deaths occur due to\\r\\nmalaria, and many more fall sick and suffer. Malaria fever\\r\\nincreases risk of abortions. Some other illnesses also\\r\\nspread due to mosquitoes. We can avoid all this at little\\r\\ncost and effort.\\r\\nWastewater pools also stink. They make life difficult for those\\r\\nstaying nearby.\\r\\nIt is a hazard for small children. Children can fall in these\\r\\ncesspools and hurt themselves.\\r\\nWe can put the wastewater to good use for a kitchen garden.\\r\\nThis will enrich our meals and avoid sleep less nights. If kitchen garden is not\\r\\npossible we can dispose wastewater through a soak pit.\\r\\n7\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nHow do wastewater pools\\r\\nharm our health? How to\\r\\ndispose wastewater in\\r\\nvillage so that this is seen\\r\\nan asset and not a health\\r\\nhazard?\\r\\nMaking a kitchen garden\\r\\nand a soak pit\\r\\nA Kitchen garden\\r\\nKitchen garden is a way to use wastewater to produce vegetables for\\r\\nourselves. The plants use up the water and we get fresh vegetables at no\\r\\nextra cost. What we need is only some place to do\\r\\nthis. The vegetables we can grow are:\\r\\nfenugreek, spinach, dhaniya, carrots,\\r\\ntomatoes, gourds, lentils etc. We can have\\r\\nabout 20 varieties of vegetables. We\\r\\nshould also grow commonly available\\r\\nmedicinal herbs such as Tulsi, Kumari,\\r\\nPodina etc alongwith vegetables for use\\r\\nof common ailments.\\r\\nIf we have more waste water, perennial\\r\\ntrees, fruits and plants like drumstick, mango,\\r\\nguava, lime, papaya and banana Most people like\\r\\nfruits and we certainly need them for vitamins and minerals.\\r\\nMaking a Soak pit\\r\\nSoak pit must be used to avoid pools of water, particularly in the streets and\\r\\ncommon pathways.\\r\\nWe can construct a soak pit near our house and around public places. This will\\r\\nabsorb drumfuls of water without forming a pool. This will avoid breeding\\r\\nplaces for mosquitoes.\\r\\nDig a pit of 1.5 meter length, breadth and depth. At the bottom put loose stones\\r\\nand brickbats. After filling 1/3 of the pit put smaller\\r\\nhalf size brickbats. Fill 1/3 of the pit thus. Fill\\r\\nthe top third of the pit even smaller\\r\\nbrickbats.\\r\\nWe need to avoid rain water from\\r\\nentering the pit. For this raise its\\r\\nborders by 10 centimeters above the\\r\\nground level. Fill it with dry grass or\\r\\ncoconut coir on top. Better put a used\\r\\nearthen pot at top, with hole in bottom.\\r\\n26 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nThis helps in straining. Connect the wastewater into this pot by using a pipe.\\r\\nCover entire area with coir. The coir works like a filter. Clean or change the coir\\r\\nevery month.\\r\\nYou can learn and teach people by demonstrating a soak pit construction. You\\r\\nmay also get more information from Panchayat. Explain people about nuisance\\r\\nof waste water. Motivate people to develop kitchen garden in their houses.\\r\\nDiscuss this issue in the village planning meeting. People can help each other\\r\\nin constructing soak pits.\\r\\nWhat do you think of this?\\r\\n\\u0002 Think of a village without pools of stagnated dirty water? Who will help you\\r\\nin making this happen?\\r\\n\\u0002 How will you raise awareness on hazards of indiscriminate waste\\r\\nwater disposal?\\r\\n27DISPOSAL OF WASTE WATER\\r\\nOur Health Depends\\r\\non Food We Eat!\\r\\nFood: Critical to good health\\r\\n\\u0002 We all need to eat enough and good food every day to stay healthy.\\r\\n\\u0002 Eating all types of food is necessary for\\r\\nkeeping our body fighting fit.\\r\\n\\u0002 We need to eat more food when recovering\\r\\nfrom illness.\\r\\n\\u0002 A child needs more food for growth. So do\\r\\nadolescents.\\r\\n\\u0002 Heavy work requires more food.\\r\\n\\u0002 Men need little more food for energy in the\\r\\nbody than women.\\r\\n\\u0002 A woman needs more food in pregnancy and breast feeding. She also needs\\r\\nsupplement of iron and calcium.\\r\\n\\u0002 Certain foods need to be avoided in certain diseases.\\r\\n\\u0002 All grains and cereals are our staple food. They give us most of energy and\\r\\nproteins. But we need to eat enough of these. Similarly non veg.\\r\\ncommunities take meat and fish.\\r\\n\\u0002 Malnutrition contributes to more than half of childhood deaths.\\r\\n8\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nThe importance of food\\r\\nelements and simple\\r\\nnutrition messages.\\r\\nHealthy dietary practices\\r\\nFood items in the meals should have all the tastes. Sweet food are heavy to\\r\\ndigest and hence should be consumed first. Avoid overeating. Always try to\\r\\nheat, when one feels appetite. Do not skip meals for long intervals if there is\\r\\nno medical indication. While eating the simple rule is – donot overfill the\\r\\nstomach, one third of the stomach should remain empty for facilitating\\r\\nproper movements and digestion of food. Do not eat too hot, too cold and too\\r\\nspicy food. Never eat hurriedly. Combination of dal and cereals (like khicri) is\\r\\nhealthy practice.\\r\\n\\u0002 We should eat thoroughly washed vegetables and fruits as well as\\r\\ncooked meals.\\r\\n\\u0002 We should eat sprouted grains as often as possible. Such grains are rich\\r\\nwith nutrients.\\r\\n\\u0002 Washing and then cutting vegetables saves important vitamins and\\r\\nminerals. If we cut and then wash, these elements are wasted. (Find out the\\r\\ndifference yourself. Which process makes the wash-water green?)\\r\\n\\u0002 Iron vessels are good for cooking food as they provide iron.\\r\\n\\u0002 Use clean utensils for cooking food.\\r\\n\\u0002 Covering food while cooking saves some vitamins.\\r\\n\\u0002 Fresh cooked food is better than stale food. Avoid storing cooked food and\\r\\nstore until next meal.\\r\\n\\u0002 Food should be covered to protect from dirt and insects.\\r\\n\\u0002 Washing hands before cooking and eating prevents germs entering\\r\\nour bodies.\\r\\n\\u0002 Feed children more often, 4-5 times a day. They need to eat frequently.\\r\\nFrom one year onwards, child can eat from family pot.\\r\\nWhat is balanced diet?\\r\\nFood has five basic elements: fats (fats from oils and ghee), proteins (white of\\r\\negg, pulses-milk) carbohydrates (cereals, sugar, sweets), minerals like calcium\\r\\nor iron, and vitamins. Minerals and vitamins are necessary in minute quantities.\\r\\nYou will learn about nutritional values of commonly consumed food.\\r\\nFood grains like rice, wheat, sorghum, maize, ragi, bajra etc make the bulk of\\r\\nour daily food. They give us energy. Some people think that only rice and wheat\\r\\nare good. The reality is different. Bajra, ragi, jowar, maize are not inferior foods.\\r\\nThese also rich in nutrients.\\r\\n29OUR HEALTH DEPENDS ON FOOD WE EAT!\\r\\nPulses and beans provide body building\\r\\nelements. Meat, eggs, fish and milk and milk\\r\\nproducts are richer in proteins.\\r\\nOils and ghee provide lubrication\\r\\nbesides extra energy. Children need to\\r\\neat enough fats. Weight for weight,\\r\\nthey give double energy as compared\\r\\nto cereals.\\r\\nGreen leafy vegetables and fruits help in blood\\r\\nformation. Vegetables also give us the fiber\\r\\n(roughage) necessary for normal bowel movements.\\r\\nBody requires some minerals like calcium, iron, iodine and zinc. Some\\r\\nnutrients called vitamins are necessary in small quantities. Both these are\\r\\npresent in vegetables, fruits, sprouts and salts.\\r\\nYou know that drinking water is good for you, but did you know that every\\r\\nsystems and organ of body depends on water. Water is essential for all\\r\\nbody functions.\\r\\nDo not\\r\\n\\u0002 Do not drain and throw away extra water while cooking rice.\\r\\n\\u0002 Do not overcook vegetables.\\r\\n\\u0002 Do not over polish rice or remove bran from flour.\\r\\nConcept of a square meal –A\\r\\ncolourful meal\\r\\nA square meal has many colours.\\r\\n\\u0002 The grains are white or brown.\\r\\nEggs and fish are also white-\\r\\ngrey. Milk and curds is white\\r\\n\\u0002 Pulses are yellow. So are fats\\r\\nand some fruits\\r\\n\\u0002 Leafy Vegetables are green.\\r\\n\\u0002 Fruits are mostly red and orange. So\\r\\nis meat and chicken.\\r\\n30 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nTogether they provide all the necessary elements for health. Combination of\\r\\nfoods like pulses with grains (khichdi is good), and lemon with vegetables\\r\\nimproves quality of food.Lemon, guava and Amla increase iron absorption and\\r\\nhelp make our blood healthy red. Fermentation and sprouting increase vitamins\\r\\nin the food.\\r\\nAvoid junk foods\\r\\nMany people like junk foods like cold-drinks, pastries, chocolates, and overfried\\r\\nfood items. These are available in many villages and roadside shops now. Hats\\r\\nand fairs also offer such foods. Children and young people take to such fancies.\\r\\nAre they really good?\\r\\nNo, nutritionally they are not good : these are also unnecessary. They may have\\r\\nharmful preservatives in them. The costs are high in comparison to our usual\\r\\nfoods e.g. Sattu made at home. So we have a double loss.\\r\\nWhat do you think about this?\\r\\n\\u0002 Pregnant women, breast-feeding mothers, growing children and\\r\\nadolescents have special nutritional needs. Do we give them less?\\r\\n\\u0002 Cleanliness in food handling and storage is as important.\\r\\n\\u0002 Whether a person eats vegetarian or non-vegetarian food, balance in\\r\\neating all elements is necessary.\\r\\n\\u0002 Food fads and taboos can lead to poor health. What are common food fads?\\r\\n\\u0002 Gur –chana, palak, Soya, idli-sambar, sattu are healthy foods.\\r\\nA healthy person has healthy weight\\r\\nOur body weight is due to our bones, flesh and blood.\\r\\nA growing child gains weight regularly. Generally a child triples its birth\\r\\nweight at the age of one year. Adult maintains body weight. Weight\\r\\nreduces in old age.\\r\\nUnderweight is because of under-eating. Majority of village women and young\\r\\ngirls have low weight. Poor diet leads to poor growth in children. Several\\r\\nchildren in our society are malnourished.\\r\\nOver-eating leads to storage of fat in the body. Fat people can get certain\\r\\nillnesses—high BP, heart attacks, diabetes, joint pains etc.\\r\\n31OUR HEALTH DEPENDS ON FOOD WE EAT!\\r\\nHence measuring weight is important\\r\\n\\u0002 Child who is not gaining weight or losing weight can be eating less or be a\\r\\nsick child (Learn it from Anganwadi behen).\\r\\n\\u0002 Pregnant woman should gain weight steadily.(learn it from nurse didi)\\r\\n\\u0002 Diseases like TB, AIDS and cancer cause weight loss.\\r\\nWhat do you feel about this?\\r\\n\\u0003 Some people think it is good to be fat. Others think it is good.\\r\\n\\u0003 Fasting does not kill. Gluttony does.\\r\\n\\u0003 Good stamina for work comes from food and exercise.\\r\\n\\u0003 A woman’s duty is to eat after everyone in the family.\\r\\n\\u0003 A pregnant mother should eat less to have a safe childbirth.\\r\\n\\u0003 Malnutrition comes from hunger and starvation. But sometimes even\\r\\nrich people are malnourished.\\r\\n32 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nOrgans and systems\\r\\nLike we build our house, nature has built our bodies. For a house we need\\r\\nstones, bricks, mud and cement, wood, tins or roof, tiles, pipes\\r\\nand wires etc. From these we build foundation, pillars, walls,\\r\\nrooms, windows, doors, floors, water supply, lighting, kitchen\\r\\nchulha, drainage etc. All these parts have different purposes.\\r\\nSimilarly in the body we have many parts or organs for\\r\\ndifferent functions. Together they make the human body.\\r\\nDifferent organs doing different work are linked together\\r\\nas organ systems. Various systems do various tasks\\r\\nnecessary for life. So we have systems for breathing, blood\\r\\ncirculation, digestion, movement, waste management etc. And all the body\\r\\nsystems work in cooperation. The body has control systems for this, viz brain,\\r\\nnerves and hormones.\\r\\nBones and muscles make the frame and walls. This also makes movement\\r\\npossible. Small and big, we have about 206 bones in the body of different\\r\\nshapes. About 100 bones are just in our hands and feet. The joints make\\r\\nmovement possible. Hips, knees, shoulder, elbow wrists, ankle are all joints. And\\r\\njoints are so different.\\r\\nBody Mapping and\\r\\nOverview of Organs\\r\\n9\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nDifferent organs of our body,\\r\\nmapping organs on the body\\r\\nand about which organ\\r\\ndoes what.\\r\\nYou may have seen the guts of sheep or\\r\\nchicken. Human gut is about 22 ft long-\\r\\nmore than a room length. Gut is part of\\r\\nthe digestive system and digests/absorbs\\r\\nfood. While passing through, food will\\r\\nbe mixed with secretions from different\\r\\nglands. It also throws off the waste.\\r\\nWhatever body cannot put to use in sent\\r\\nin large intestine and later leaves body\\r\\nthrough anal opening. Digestion gives us\\r\\nenergy to work and nutrients to build and\\r\\nrepair the body.\\r\\nRespiratory system provides us with oxygen by breathing air. Lungs inside\\r\\nour chest cavity helps us in inhalation and exhalation. Impure air is let\\r\\nout. Oxygen is necessary for burning food to produce energy.\\r\\nWe have about 5-6 liters of blood in our body. This goes in rounds thanks to\\r\\nour heart pumping each second. Do you know how much blood the heart pumps\\r\\nin a day? That will fill a water tanker of 10000 liters in 24 hrs. The heart keeps\\r\\nyour blood pumping at all times as it picks up oxygen from your lungs and\\r\\nnutrients from digestive system and send them to different cells of body.\\r\\nYounger you are faster is your heart beat. The blood carries nutrients and\\r\\noxygen. It also picks up wastes from the organs. Blood works like trucks and\\r\\nwagons in the body, through the vessels.\\r\\nUrinary system throws away urine and cleanses the body. Skin also throws out sweat.\\r\\nReproductive system is different in men and women. It helps in reproduction\\r\\nand continuation of life on earth.\\r\\nWe know the world through our five windows. We call them sense organs. The\\r\\neyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue tastes and skin gets touch, pressure,\\r\\nvibration and pain.\\r\\nThanks to the Nervous system, we respond to these signals. Human brain is\\r\\nmost complex object in the world. We make necessary movement or change\\r\\nalertness. This is necessary for our survival. The Nervous system controls several\\r\\nbody functions. Nerves act as electric wires to control all systems.\\r\\n34 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nMapping and learning more about our body\\r\\nSome of our organs are seen from outside like eyes, ears, breasts, testes. Let us\\r\\nsee where the other organs are –\\r\\nBony skeleton and attached muscles give body its basic frame. Skin covers all\\r\\nthe body and protects it from outside environment. Soft organs are inside the\\r\\nchest and abdomen. Brain is inside the skull.\\r\\nA butterfly like important gland (Thyroid) is present in front of the neck. Goitre\\r\\nis actually a swelling of this. Iodized salt prevents it.\\r\\nWhen we take a deep breath the chest expands. The lungs inside the chest and\\r\\nfill like balloons. The wind pipe in the neck connects the nose throat to the lungs.\\r\\nIt indeed looks like an upside down tree, the windpipe in the place of trunk.\\r\\nFear or excitement speeds up the heart. Normally heart beats are 72-84 times\\r\\nin a minute. We can feel the beats pounding in the chest. Put an ear to your\\r\\nfriend’s chest. Can you hear heart beats? Where is it? Heart is just left of the\\r\\nmiddle of the chest. Pipe like blood vessels connect the heart to rest of the\\r\\nbody. These carry blood from heart to all parts. Can you see the veins under your\\r\\nskin? Blood is brought back to heart through veins.\\r\\nLet us drink a glass of cold water. Do you feel it going down from throat to\\r\\nstomach? Food pipe carries food and drinks to stomach in the middle of upper\\r\\nabdomen. Stomach stores and digests food for 1-2 hours. Then the food passes\\r\\ndown the gut.\\r\\nDo you feel the rumbling in abdomen when you are hungry? A long coil of gut\\r\\nis in the middle of abdomen. This does further digestion. The long coils lead to\\r\\na wider short pipe called colon. The well known appendix sits on the colon on\\r\\nlower right corner. Appendix does not serve any special purpose in the body.\\r\\nColon is a bent pipe set against the abdomen walls– going up from lower right\\r\\nside, and then becomes horizontal going left. Then it goes down to the bag\\r\\nstoring waste. Finally it reaches the anus.\\r\\nLiver is high up on the right side. A swollen liver can be felt below the lower\\r\\nright ribs. Similarly on the left side we have a small spleen. In some diseases\\r\\nsuch as Malaria, spleen becomes very big. We can feel it below the left side ribs.\\r\\n35BODY MAPPING AND OVERVIEW OF ORGANS\\r\\nTwo kidneys are filters of blood making urine. They sit on the very back wall of\\r\\nabdomen. Urine from kidneys reaches urinary bladder through tubes.\\r\\nOne feels tense in the lower abdomen when urine is held up for a long time.\\r\\nThat is where the urinary bladder is. From bladder the urine is let out through\\r\\na single tube opening on genitals.\\r\\nReproductive organs are different in men and women.\\r\\nTestes are hanging in a pouch to keep them cool. From the testes two thick\\r\\ncords carry sperms to two small bags close to urethra. They make semen\\r\\ncarrying sperms. The semen is thrown out through urethra at the end of\\r\\nsexual intercourse.\\r\\nIn women vagina is a passage from private parts to opening of uterus. Uterus\\r\\n–the womb-is a small purse with thick walls, hanging upside-down in the\\r\\nlower abdomen. It is protected by the pelvic bones. The womb grows in\\r\\npregnancy with the growing baby inside. In pregnancy we can feel the womb\\r\\non the abdomen.\\r\\nTwo egg-tubes are attached to uterus on both sides. The tubes have free finger\\r\\nlike ends. The fingers catch the eggs released from ovaries. The two ovaries\\r\\nflank the uterus.\\r\\nOuter parts of genitals are also different in men and women.\\r\\nIn men testes are hanging in a pouch on each side. The urethra opens on the\\r\\nend of a long muscular penis.\\r\\nIn women urethra and vagina open on the vulva. Inner vulva is soft tags of\\r\\nflesh. These are aptly called inner lips of vulva. The inner lips are connected\\r\\nabove at clitoris. Clitoris is small external bud like organ. A fleshy cushion of\\r\\nvulva–called outer lips–protect all these parts.\\r\\nThe vulva completely folds over vagina in very young girls. Hymen, a thin sheet\\r\\nwith holes covers the vaginal opening. This may be torn after puberty. After\\r\\npuberty the vulva also opens up baring clitoris. Breasts also grow in women at\\r\\nthe age of maturity.\\r\\nAt maturity both men and women have hair on the genitals.\\r\\n36 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nMany young boys and girls are unawares of these differences. During\\r\\nadolescence their bodies start changing and maturing. They become sensitive\\r\\nto the differences. You will know more about the health needs of the\\r\\nadolescents in subsequent books.\\r\\nGirls may be embarrassed by the growing breasts and height, and some of them\\r\\ntake to stooping posture. Boys often worry about the differences in the size of\\r\\ngrowing penis. Differences in growing moustache or beard and change in pitch\\r\\nof voice can also bother adolescent boys.\\r\\nExplain these changes to growing children. With maturation comes the\\r\\nresponsibility. Responsible sexual behavior is necessary for health.\\r\\nWe will learn more about organs and systems when it is pertinent for an illness.\\r\\nThink about these:\\r\\n\\u0002 What are the functions of three openings in women’s perineal region?\\r\\n\\u0002 Why brain is most complex organ of our body?\\r\\n37BODY MAPPING AND OVERVIEW OF ORGANS\\r\\nWomen and Health\\r\\nWomen and health\\r\\nMany people in our society consider women as inferior than\\r\\nmen. Diseases amongst women and young girls are not\\r\\ntaken up seriously.\\r\\nWomen work both at home and outside. Women have\\r\\nto spend considerable time and effort for child care.\\r\\nFetching water and firewood take many hours of\\r\\nhard work by women. Tedious work in farm can lead\\r\\nto health problems.\\r\\nWomen work hard but get lower wages.\\r\\nWomen get less food at home. In\\r\\nfact they eat at the end when every one in the\\r\\nfamily has eaten. Most women are anemic and\\r\\nweak. Their weights are too low to be healthy.\\r\\nWomen are given less opportunity for education.\\r\\nWomen have less say in decisions in the family.\\r\\n10\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nWhy women suffer more ill\\r\\nhealth and neglect\\r\\nAttitudes of society on\\r\\nwomen’s health\\r\\nMany men women treat women badly, and\\r\\neven beat them. Women are also sexually\\r\\nassaulted. Such women suffer from\\r\\ninjuries and other health problems.\\r\\nWomen’s health problems are often\\r\\nignored or treated late. They have to\\r\\nget permission of the in-laws or\\r\\nhusband’s even for health check up. They\\r\\noften have no money to pay for health\\r\\ncare on their own. Our health services are\\r\\nalso not fully sensitive to women’s health\\r\\ncare needs.\\r\\nInfertility can result from health problems of either husband or wife. But\\r\\nusually it is the woman who gets the blame and mis-treated.\\r\\nIf a woman gets daughters, she gets the blame again. In reality it all depends\\r\\non the man’s sperm. We will learn later to see how the sex of the baby is\\r\\ndetermined. Many families go for abortion if it is a girl baby in the womb as\\r\\nthey want sons. You can check from your anganwadi behen as how many boys\\r\\nand girls are registered at Aanganwadi centre.\\r\\nWomen bear all the trouble of childbirth, abortions. They also bear burden of\\r\\npreventing pregnancies. Most contraceptive methods are for women and very\\r\\nfew for men.\\r\\nWomen’s reproductive systems are more vulnerable for sexually\\r\\ntransmitted infections. Vagina provides a larger surface,\\r\\ndelicate skin, longer time to hold fluids, moistness to\\r\\nmake germs stay alive for longer. So they get more\\r\\ninfections than men.\\r\\nEven illnesses affect women differently. Malaria fever\\r\\ncan cause abortions, affect growth of baby in the womb.\\r\\nOn top of all, women are married young. They suffer its\\r\\ndamage in several ways-socially, economically, and\\r\\nto health.\\r\\n39WOMEN AND HEALTH\\r\\nAlcoholic husbands exploit women in several\\r\\nways. They treat their family member\\r\\nharshly everyday to show off the\\r\\nmanhood. It makes women’s already\\r\\ndifficult lives all the more miserable.\\r\\nThere are fewer amenities for toilets for\\r\\nwomen. In the village, they have to go to\\r\\nanswer nature’s call either early morning\\r\\nor evening.\\r\\nVillages may have no air pollution, but that is not\\r\\ntrue for women. They work in kitchen smoke for 4-5 hrs everyday. It gives\\r\\nthem coughs and headaches.\\r\\nAnd do you know, still they are hardy enough to live longer than men. If\\r\\nthey get the justice in our families and villages, they will be healthier still.\\r\\nWhat we can do\\r\\nLet women also take part in making decisions in the family and village. They should\\r\\nparticipate in all meetings. This will make decisions wiser and more practical.\\r\\n\\u0002 Discuss with men to share domestic work and child care.\\r\\n\\u0002 Encourage Women to eat well and take enough rest.\\r\\n\\u0002 Encourage girls to go to higher school and learn.\\r\\n\\u0002 Try to stop physical or mental abuse of women.\\r\\n\\u0002 Do not ignore women’s health complaints.\\r\\n\\u0002 Raise your boys and girls with equal respect and love.\\r\\nLet us think about it\\r\\n\\u0002 Pregnancy and Child care can be shared by the couple.\\r\\n\\u0002 Is it right to sex-select babies like some people do? Can our world be\\r\\nwithout women?\\r\\n\\u0002 Women and men are born equal. There are many goddesses in our\\r\\nmythology. Then how can we ill-treat and abuse women?\\r\\n\\u0002 Why men don’t come forward to accept contraception?\\r\\n40 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nOrganising\\r\\nA Group Meeting\\r\\nIn this lesson we will learn about one way of communication —\\r\\nGroup meetings. You have to match the group, topic and method\\r\\nof communication. Mismatch of these three will not produce any\\r\\nimpact. For instance for bringing behavioral change about\\r\\nsanitary latrine, we need to talk to women (and men).\\r\\nWe can plan and do it as follows:\\r\\nGet a group of 5-10 women/men (not more) in\\r\\nsomebody’s house. It is good to select a\\r\\nvenue which is accessible to all\\r\\nespecially women from scheduled\\r\\ncastes/ tribes are comfortable. It is\\r\\nuseful to select a house, which\\r\\nalready have a sanitary latrine.\\r\\nYou need to communicate to people\\r\\nin advance about the venue and\\r\\ntiming of this meeting. You can also\\r\\ntalk with members of self help group in\\r\\nthe village.\\r\\n11\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nHow to organize a group\\r\\nmeeting\\r\\nWe can start about health hazard and problems due to openair defecation. Just\\r\\nprovide the beginning or let someone begin.\\r\\nGradually other members of group will also start\\r\\nparticipating in the discussion and share\\r\\ntheir problems.\\r\\nIf we have a model or flip chart about\\r\\nsanitary latrine, we can share it now. If\\r\\nsomeone in the village has got a\\r\\nsanitary latrine to a smokeless one, that\\r\\ncan be a demonstration.\\r\\nExplain the basics of the sanitary latrine,\\r\\nand how one can make it. A good flip chart will\\r\\nhave all that explained in pictures.\\r\\nDiscuss ways of how Panchayat can help families in constructing sanitary\\r\\nlatrines and what assistance is available.\\r\\nWhile conducting a group meeting:\\r\\n\\u0002 Set up some ground rules in the beginning. Let one person speak at a time.\\r\\nTalk with participants with full interest and eye contact. You should be\\r\\nconvinced of the topic yourself for full confidence.\\r\\n\\u0002 Let your audience participate in the discussions .Encourage them to ask\\r\\nquestions. Some people will come out with good ideas. Never scold or\\r\\nridicule anyone. Let things proceed in democratic manner. Let people\\r\\nsuggest solutions.\\r\\n\\u0002 Do not open up topics which are ambiguous or difficult. The message\\r\\nshould be clear and doable for the group.\\r\\n\\u0002 You may not complete the topic in the same meeting. One can follow it up\\r\\nin the next opportunity. But take things a step ahead.\\r\\n\\u0002 Communication is effective if we follow our own advice at our home.\\r\\nPeople learn better with live example. They learn even better by doing it\\r\\nthemselves. Mere talk, pictures, slogans, songs may not work. (These things\\r\\nhave a complementary role)\\r\\n\\u0002 Do not underplay the complexity of the problem. Problems can be really\\r\\ncomplex. We need to understand the factors and the interplay. For instance\\r\\n42 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nsome people say that there is no water to\\r\\nuse in sanitary latrine. Now you have to\\r\\ncome up with solutions.\\r\\nChange may be slow. However in every\\r\\ncommunity there are some innovators\\r\\nwho are open to new ideas. You need\\r\\nto encourage them . Sometimes new\\r\\ngeneration takes up changes faster\\r\\nthan old people. Change is often slow.\\r\\nPeople cannot give up traditions easily\\r\\nsince they find it easy to work with. New\\r\\nthings need adjustment.\\r\\nAt the end sum up the discussion and what was decided in this meeting.\\r\\nThink about following :\\r\\n\\u0002 Some people dominate in group meetings and while some do not speak at\\r\\nall. What should be done?\\r\\n\\u0002 I lack confidence while speaking in a group. What should be done?\\r\\n43ORGANISING A GROUP MEETING\\r\\nOur health workers\\r\\nDai: In each village you will come to know\\r\\nabout Dai ma. There may be more than\\r\\none dai ma\\r\\nin a village.\\r\\nDais conduct child birth, although it is not\\r\\npossible for them to manage women\\r\\nwhen there are difficulties during child\\r\\nbirth. You need to develop rapport with\\r\\ndais in your village. Try to find out them\\r\\nif they have undergone any training in\\r\\npast. We will know more about Dai in\\r\\nfollowing chapter.\\r\\nAnganwadi Behen: Do you know about the\\r\\nanganwadi behen in your village. What are her\\r\\nfunctions. We will know more about her work in the following chapter.\\r\\nYou will have to work very closely with anganwadi behen. One day in each\\r\\nmonth is observed as “Health Day” at centre. You need to mobilize children,\\r\\npregnant women for health services offered by nurse Didi on health day.\\r\\nKnow Health\\r\\nServices\\r\\n12\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nWho are the health workers\\r\\nin village?\\r\\nWhat do we mean by sub\\r\\ncentres and PHCs?\\r\\nNurse Didi: Where does our nursedidi work from? It is a health sub center. The\\r\\nsub center actually works for 5-6 villages (3000-5000 population). We have a\\r\\nnursedidi called ANM and a health worker brother called Male Multipurpose\\r\\nWorker (MPW). Together they do various tasks for the villages. We will need to\\r\\nwork with them more closely.\\r\\nThe Health Sub Center\\r\\nLet us look at our sub center more closely. The\\r\\nhealth sub center may be your nearest health\\r\\nfacility. Our sub center has a nursedidi and\\r\\na MPW. Their main tasks are:\\r\\n\\u0002 Immunization of children to\\r\\nprevent six dangerous illnesses.\\r\\nRoutine checkup of pregnant\\r\\nwomen, conducting normal\\r\\ndeliveries and post natal care.\\r\\n\\u0002 Helping couples to adopt spacing\\r\\nand sterilization services.\\r\\n\\u0002 Treatment for TB, Leprosy and Malaria\\r\\n\\u0002 Treatment of minor ailments.\\r\\n\\u0002 Visiting Anganwadis and schools for health check up.\\r\\n\\u0002 Child care including treatment for diarrhea and coughs\\r\\n\\u0002 Advice on village sanitation, water safety etc.\\r\\nThe ANM and MPW have difficult tasks. The villages under their care spread\\r\\nout on 8-10 km area. They have to often walk distances, and be on move. They\\r\\nvisit houses to conduct provide some services. For some services like\\r\\nImmunization, they conduct clinics on a fixed day each month in a central\\r\\nplace such as anganwadi centres in the village. They have also to make reports\\r\\nof monthly health activities and attend meetings at PHCs.\\r\\nWe can do this\\r\\nDevelop good links with nursedidi and MPW. Know about the facilities available\\r\\nwith them. Help them in their tasks.\\r\\nWhat do you think about this?\\r\\n\\u0002 People say the nursedidi hardly stays at one place.\\r\\n\\u0002 People call the MPW as the malaria worker.\\r\\n45KNOW HEALTH SERVICES\\r\\n\\u0002 Village people don’t support nursedididi, in her work.\\r\\n\\u0002 Is nursedidi she doing only family planning work?\\r\\nA Primary Health Center (PHC)\\r\\nA PHC is usually at some big village in your area. Your block may have 5-10\\r\\nPHCs. Each PHC has 5-6 sub centres and serves 25000-30000 population. Each\\r\\nvillage falls under one of them. Have you ever been to the PHC?\\r\\nA PHC has 1-2 doctors, nurses, compounder and other staff. With its 4-6\\r\\nsubcenters the PHC’s main activity is for preventing diseases, promoting health\\r\\nand treatment of illnesses. Here are the main activities:\\r\\nNational health programmes related to Women and child health, malaria,\\r\\nfilariasis, TB, Leprosy, Blindness, sexually transmitted infections and HIV-AIDS.\\r\\nSome specific activities are:\\r\\n\\u0002 Immunization against six diseases.\\r\\n\\u0002 Health services for pregnancy, childbirth and after.\\r\\n\\u0002 Health check up and treatment of school children.\\r\\n\\u0002 Control of disease outbreaks- like diarrhea.\\r\\n\\u0002 Treatment of diseases.\\r\\n\\u0002 Birth spacing and sterilization, early and safe abortions.\\r\\n\\u0002 Health education to promote health and prevent illnesses.\\r\\n\\u0002 Camps for disease detection and treatment, sterilization etc.\\r\\n\\u0002 Health care during of haats and melas.\\r\\n\\u0002 Medico-legal work.\\r\\n46 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nThe PHC doctor has many tasks to do. Treatment of illnesses is just one. He also\\r\\nhas meetings to attend and he may also be required to conduct post-mortems.\\r\\nPHC doctors treat illnesses in the Out Patient Department (OPD). Some patients\\r\\nare admitted in the PHC. Sub center health workers refer patients to PHC. The\\r\\nPHC may also refer some patients to the CHC or District hospital. Some patients\\r\\nmay need to go to the district hospital.\\r\\nEach PHC doctor also visits sub centres covered by that PHC. Doctor has to\\r\\nsupervise work of nursediddi, meet villagers and also provide services.\\r\\nWe can do this\\r\\nInform people about the facilities available at these health centers. For\\r\\ninstance, talk of childbirth or TB treatment and free care.  \\r\\nMotivate people to use available services at the health centers.\\r\\nDiscuss with the doctor or nurse about the health problems of your village\\r\\ncommunity. Inform them about unusual health problems in your village.\\r\\nWhat do you think about this?\\r\\n\\u0002 Do people expect free services from a PHC?\\r\\n\\u0002 How can we help improve the working of this center?\\r\\n\\u0002 Many people complaint about poor quality of drugs offered at PHCs.\\r\\nIs this true?\\r\\n47KNOW HEALTH SERVICES\\r\\nAnganwadi Centre\\r\\nAnganwadi\\r\\nThe village Anganwadi is the place where children under six years gather\\r\\neveryday for three-four hours.\\r\\nThe Anganwadi-behen’s activities are:\\r\\n\\u0002 Weighing children every month and record on a chart.\\r\\n\\u0002 If a child is not gaining or losing weight, she\\r\\ntries to help.\\r\\n\\u0002 Supplementary feeds for children.\\r\\n\\u0002 Offer supplementary food to pregnant\\r\\nmothers too.\\r\\n\\u0002 Helping with pre-primary education for\\r\\nchildren—through stories, pictures,\\r\\nsongs etc.\\r\\n\\u0002 Advising the mothers about healthy ways of\\r\\npreparing foods.\\r\\n13\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nThe village Anganwadi\\r\\ncentre,\\r\\nThe services offered through\\r\\nAnganwadi.\\r\\nHow can ASHA and AWW\\r\\nhelp each other?\\r\\n\\u0002 Getting health check done for the children. The nurse didi (and sometime,\\r\\nDoctor) check the children every month. Sick children get medicines. She\\r\\nalso refers sick children\\r\\n\\u0002 Helping in Immunization of children.\\r\\n\\u0002 Registration of births and deaths at the village Panchayat.\\r\\n\\u0002 With help of Anganwadi-behen, we can detect child malnutrition in time\\r\\nand help to those suffering with malnutrition.\\r\\nAnganwadi-behen needs help\\r\\nYou can help her in so many ways.\\r\\nThe babies younger than 3 years cannot\\r\\ncome on their own in the AW. Mothers\\r\\nsometimes bring them to AW at\\r\\nmealtime. However, often they are\\r\\neither left at home or taken along on\\r\\nwork. Many babies suffer under\\r\\nnutrition after breastfeeding stops.\\r\\nThey remain undernourished. How can\\r\\nwe help in this problem?\\r\\nParents assume that the child gets a full meal in\\r\\nthe Anganwadi, and may give it less in the home. This makes the\\r\\nsupplement less helpful. you need to talk to child’s parents on this.\\r\\nSome difficulties about regular food supply affect AW services. You can\\r\\nraise these issues during meetings with Panchayat members.\\r\\nAnganwadi-behen has some records to keep. She is often hard working and\\r\\ngives lot of time for this work. She can be of great help to you in all your\\r\\nworks. With her help, you can improve child health services and services\\r\\nfor mothers.\\r\\nShe also has some medicines for common illnesses. You can get help from her\\r\\nif you have some medicines in short supply.\\r\\n49ANGANWADI CENTRE\\r\\nThings we can do for improving Anganwadi\\r\\n\\u0002 Register all children below 6 years of age to Anganwadi. Encourage\\r\\nthe parents to send their children to Anganwadi regularly once they\\r\\nare registered.\\r\\n\\u0002 Help the Anganwadi-behen in her activities. Learn the tasks like weighing\\r\\nbabies, detecting illnesses mark growth charts and understand if there is\\r\\nweight loss.\\r\\n\\u0002 Counsel the mother (and father also) at home, with help of Anganwadi-\\r\\nbehen. Talk to her about right feeding of care of the child.\\r\\n\\u0002 Motivate the mothers to get check up done during pregnancy and motivate\\r\\nparents to get their children immunised.\\r\\nWhat do we think about?\\r\\n\\u0002 Some people say Anganwadi is only a feeding center.\\r\\n\\u0002 People complain about quality and quantity of food given to children\\r\\nat centres!\\r\\n\\u0002 Do children wash their hands before eating at centers?\\r\\n\\u0002 Some children take food back home. This food is hared at home with others.\\r\\nIs this good?\\r\\n\\u0002 Many times nursedidi does not come on scheduled health day?\\r\\n50 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nVillage Birth\\r\\nAttendant or DAI\\r\\nDai’s work and practices\\r\\n\\u0002 Dai helps families during childbirth. She is trained by PHC\\r\\nand ANM to observe Six cleans.\\r\\n\\u0002 A clean place to conduct delivery\\r\\n\\u0002 Clean hands with water and soap before delivery.\\r\\n\\u0002 A clean perineum to avoid infection of mother\\r\\nand baby.\\r\\n\\u0002 Clean thread to tie the umbilical cord and\\r\\n\\u0002 A clean new blade to cut the cord and keep the\\r\\nend clean.\\r\\n\\u0002 A clean cloth to wrap the baby\\r\\nWith this she can ensure the health of the newborn baby and mother. She can\\r\\nsave babies with proper baby care. She is also expected to send mothers with\\r\\ndifficulties to health centers in time.\\r\\nLimitations of a Dai\\r\\nDais have limited understanding of a difficult birth and risks. Often they refer\\r\\na mother too late. They need good training and help to understand impending\\r\\ndangers and refer-escort in good time. Some village dais act as a cord cutter\\r\\n14\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nThe Dai and her work\\r\\nThe six clean practices\\r\\nin childbirth\\r\\nLimitations of Dai\\r\\nHow we can help and learn\\r\\nfrom her\\r\\nonly. She is not very active on the after care. This period is important for both\\r\\nthe mother and the child.\\r\\nOften she gets no support from families.\\r\\nSkilled Birth Attendant\\r\\nA skilled birth attendant is one who knows how to conduct deliveries,\\r\\nprevent, diagnosis and manage complications, and refer in childbirth. She can\\r\\ndetect dangers soon enough, do necessary things to avoid complications and\\r\\noffer primary treatment like stitching wounds and give medicines for\\r\\nstopping prolonged bleeding. She is trained and equipped to do this. The\\r\\nNursedidi can be a good Skilled Birth attendant. It will be good if families can\\r\\ntake the mother to the nearest health center for childbirth, or the Nursedidi\\r\\nattend at home.\\r\\nThings we can do\\r\\n\\u0002 Help the Dai while she conducts delivery.\\r\\n\\u0002 Find out from Dai about pregnant women for ANC services.\\r\\n\\u0002 Learn to help her in newborn care.\\r\\n\\u0002 Visit the mother with Dai and Nurse didi\\r\\nWhat do you think about this?\\r\\n\\u0002 Childbirth looks a simple matter, anybody can do it. Nothing can go wrong.\\r\\n\\u0002 Old women say they never bothered about childbirth in past.\\r\\n\\u0002 In some villages dais are considered as doing some “dirty work”\\r\\n\\u0002 Gradually number of dais in villages is going down. Soon there will be no\\r\\ndais in villages. We have now fewer dais in the village\\r\\n52 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nCauses of illnesses\\r\\nIllness is a loss of health. Often it is temporary as body heals\\r\\nitself. Sometimes it can be long lasting. Why do we fall ill?\\r\\nHere are some common causes.\\r\\n\\u0002 Unsafe water and poor personal hygiene\\r\\n\\u0002 Under nutrition and over nutrition\\r\\n\\u0002 Accidents and injury, Animal and insect bites\\r\\n\\u0002 Mental tension\\r\\n\\u0002 Changes due to ageing\\r\\n\\u0002 Pollution of air, also noise pollution.\\r\\n\\u0002 Unsafe sex\\r\\n\\u0002 Addictions\\r\\nHealing\\r\\nBody has a capacity to heal itself. Have you seen how\\r\\na tree heals its axeinjury? First the gum fills the gap. The\\r\\ngum hardens and gradually becomes wooden. Same A\\r\\nsimilar effect occurs in human body for many illnesses. So you\\r\\ncan see a scar replacing an injury. So are the scars of injury or a wound.\\r\\nIllness and Healing\\r\\n15\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nWhat is illness, its causes,\\r\\ngerm illnesses, immunity,\\r\\nhealing? In this lesson we\\r\\nwill learn only about\\r\\ngermillnesses.\\r\\nNot all illnesses make a scar after\\r\\ninjury–common cold, flu, malaria, sore-\\r\\neyes are some examples. But some\\r\\nillnesses cause a scar inside the body.\\r\\nTB is one example. It leaves a scar in\\r\\nthe lungs after cure.\\r\\nSome illnesses have a cause in the\\r\\nmind–mental illnesses.\\r\\nHealing is a natural process. Good nutrition\\r\\nand immunity help healing. Healing leads to cure.\\r\\nAnd most illnesses heal. But some can get worse as they have no cures.\\r\\nCan you name some diseases with no cure.\\r\\nGerms, worms, insects-illnesses and immunity\\r\\nMost of the common illnesses are due to germs, small insects and worms. We\\r\\ncan often see worms in the excreta. The small insects like louse are visible. The\\r\\nscabies insect is even smaller. Germs are too small to see with eyes. For this we\\r\\nneed a microscope. Have you seen a microscope.\\r\\nExamples of germ illnesses are: Malaria, chickenpox TB, measles, leprosy, many\\r\\ntypes of diarrheas and dysentery. The gravity and period of illness vary with the\\r\\ngerm-type and our resistance to that germ.\\r\\nImmunity is the resistance of our body to fight germs. Immunity develops as\\r\\nbody gets experience of\\r\\nfighting germs. Immunity helps us recover from a germ-illness. Immunity may\\r\\nbe natural like in leprosy. Remember only some people get leprosy illness, many\\r\\nescape it.\\r\\nMother’s breast milk gives some immunity for the baby. The first few days’ thick\\r\\nmilk is a priceless shield for the baby. Sadly, many infants do not get it because\\r\\nwrong beliefs and practices.\\r\\n54 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nWe can also create immunity against some germs. We give babies vaccines to\\r\\nmake them stronger against some illnesses. Complete immunization in time\\r\\nprepare body to fight against germs of certain diseases.\\r\\nFor many germ illnesses, we use medicines. TB, malaria, and leprosy are some\\r\\nillnesses we can cure with medicines.\\r\\nBut some illnesses like hydrophobia; AIDS, etc are without effective cure. These\\r\\nsmall germs are called viruses. Recently AIDS has some good medicines though\\r\\nno permanent cure is possible.\\r\\nThink about this\\r\\n\\u0002 How can we increase our resistance to illnesses so that we do not fall ill?\\r\\n\\u0002 Why we not see the small pox these days?\\r\\n\\u0002 Do you come across about hydrophobia patient in your village? Why are\\r\\npeople so afraid of a dogbite?\\r\\n55ILLNESS AND HEALING\\r\\nDifferent healing systems\\r\\nNature heals most illnesses. Our body has such healing\\r\\nproperties—like the tree healing itself. We can help the process\\r\\nof healing with medicines. We need good nutrition for that.\\r\\nWe have many types of healing systems. The Angreji system\\r\\nis well known. Ayurveda employs herbal and other\\r\\nmedicines. Sidhaa is a similar branch. Unani is also herbal\\r\\nsystem. Homeopathy uses very small dose of medicine in\\r\\nsugar based tablets. Naturopathy uses water, mud, diet etc\\r\\nfor cures. Yoga also heals some illnesses. In acupressure and\\r\\nacupuncture, special points on the body are used to cure\\r\\nhealth problems. In the village the traditional Baid\\r\\nuses herbal remedies.\\r\\nWe You will learn about some medicines in\\r\\nthis programme.\\r\\nThe Allopathic system\\r\\nAbout 300 allopathic medicines are\\r\\nessential for a hospital. For primary care\\r\\nwe need very few medicines.\\r\\nUsing Remedies\\r\\n16\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nDifferent healing systems like\\r\\nthe allopathic and Indian\\r\\nSystem of Medicine (ISM),\\r\\nUse of select allopathic\\r\\nmedicines in primary care,\\r\\nAbuse of injections and saline,\\r\\navoiding overuse of medicines.\\r\\nIn this programme you will learn to use 4\\r\\nsome internal medicines/drugs.\\r\\nParacetomol (para), chloroquine\\r\\n(chloro), Iron Folic acid (ferrous) and\\r\\nORS. You will learn to use medicines\\r\\nbelonging to other systems\\r\\n(Ayurveda) later.\\r\\nAnnexure at the end of this book tells\\r\\nyou about use of each drug; dose, how\\r\\nmany times to be given, side effects, and\\r\\nprecautions. Read carefully all this before using\\r\\nthe drugs.\\r\\nThese medicines are safe, cheap and very effective. They will help us in many\\r\\nillnesses. We will learn about some more medicines in the subsequent books.\\r\\nOveruse of Injections and saline (bottle)\\r\\nInjections and saline are necessary only in some situations.\\r\\nInjections and saline used in clinics are not so often necessary. Frequently\\r\\ninjection and saline are given for profit and not for cure. False beliefs about\\r\\ninjections and saline are rife. We become poorer by paying the hard earned\\r\\nmoney for many needless injections and saline. We can save these expenses\\r\\nwith help of simple remedies and raising health awareness. But peoples’\\r\\nattitudes take time and efforts to change.\\r\\nPatients are being charged anything like 50 Rs more for one bottle. It is just\\r\\nwater and salt and some sugar. If we prepare and drink at home it, the cost is\\r\\njust fifty paise. Its effect by mouth is also equal to saline. Some patients insists\\r\\non injections and bottles and doctors also are driven by profit motives. You can\\r\\neducate people about utility/futility of injections and bottles.\\r\\nTonics\\r\\nTonic bottles are also very popular. Many healers prescribe and patients ask for\\r\\ntonics. Are tonics necessary, do they give us strength as promised?\\r\\nThe answer is NO. No medicine book prescribes tonics. Tonics are just some\\r\\nwater, sugar, vitamins and some minerals. The cost is often very high. In the\\r\\n57USING REMEDIES\\r\\nsame cost one can take an egg daily or a glass of milk for a full month. This is\\r\\na much better buy for the money. Tonics also create a false sense of cure. Many\\r\\nparents wants their doctors to prescribe tonics for their children.\\r\\nYou need to educate people on the futility and costs of tonics. It will save\\r\\npeoples’ money being wasted. It will also help them in improving their diet.\\r\\nAvoid self-medication\\r\\nSome people buy drugs for illnesses without information. Some people use\\r\\nmedicines lying in the house for illnesses. This can be unsafe. Expired medicines\\r\\ncan cause health problems.\\r\\nAvoid overuse of medicines\\r\\nMedicines are very useful and are life saving at times. Overdose can be harmful,\\r\\nespecially in children. Medicines can have side effects too. You should ask your\\r\\ndoctors about the dosage schedule of drugs. Inadequate dosage doesn’t help.\\r\\nEducation about rational drug use in community will help our work. And\\r\\nprevention is better than cure. We need to learn and teach how we can avoid\\r\\ngetting illnesses by improving our living conditions.\\r\\nWhat do you think?\\r\\n\\u0002 Injection and saline is a must for cure.\\r\\n\\u0002 Children need tonics for weakness.\\r\\n\\u0002 There is pill and injection for every illness.\\r\\n\\u0002 People can reduce or increase weight by taking tablets.\\r\\n58 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nFive important medicinal trees and plants\\r\\nOur country has a very rich source of medicinal plants. We can use\\r\\nthese for being healthy and treat ailments at little cost. Some trees\\r\\nin the neighborhood are angels in green. We will learn about just\\r\\nfive of them now.\\r\\n1. Neem (Azadirecta Indica)\\r\\nNeem tree is well known. Its leaves, fruits and outer portion of the\\r\\nstem have medicinal property.\\r\\nLeaves are used for skin diseases like eczema, infection. The oil prepared with\\r\\nextract of neem leaves is useful in itching and wound healing.\\r\\nThe decoction of crushed neem leaves is also used for the\\r\\nsame purpose. Neem is a great antiseptic and pest-control\\r\\nmedicine. Decoction of the outer portion of its stem is also\\r\\nhelpful in various diseases. Therefore, preserve and cultivate\\r\\nneem plants.\\r\\nMaking neem oil: make 100 ml fresh juice of neem leaves.\\r\\nAdd 25 cc sesame oil to this. Slow boil the mixture under\\r\\ncover. The water part will completely evaporate in half an\\r\\nHome Remedies\\r\\n17\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nSome plants and trees with\\r\\nmedicinal use\\r\\nSimple home remedies and\\r\\nherbal remedies\\r\\nhour. Cool and filter it. This is neem oil for wound\\r\\ncare. Keep it in a well-capped bottle. It will stay\\r\\nfor one year. Apply this to wounds 2-3 times a\\r\\nday. This heals the wound well.\\r\\nFor childbirth injuries, neem water bath is a\\r\\nhealing treatment. Crush some leaves of neem\\r\\nand put them in warm bath water. Let the mother sit\\r\\nfor fifteen minutes in this bathtub.\\r\\n2. Tulsi (Oscimun Sanctum)\\r\\nTulsi is a small herb, but having great medicinal\\r\\nproperties. Tulsi leaves are mainly used for some\\r\\nailments. They are useful in cough and cold. Give\\r\\nthe tulsi juice with honey. The leaves are hot in\\r\\nnature, that is they are used in kafadosha. The\\r\\ndecoction of Tulsi leaves is also useful for\\r\\ncough. The leaves are chewable.\\r\\nThe seeds of tulsi are cold in nature. Hence the seeds\\r\\nare used in heat (pitta) disorders like heart burn, bleeding\\r\\nfrom nose, Burning feet, bleeding piles, sore mouth etc. Give the seeds with milk\\r\\nor ghee. Soak 20-30 seed grains in water or milk. This is a dose for once. Take\\r\\nit 2-3 times a day.\\r\\nTake about a cupful of tulsi leaves. Soak them in water for five minutes. Then\\r\\ncrush them on a stone. Strain in cloth and collect about 20 ml juice (half a cup).\\r\\nCrush more leave if necessary to make 20 ml. This makes 3 doses for one day\\r\\nfor an adult. This is good for cold and fever illnesses. Give it for 3 days. For\\r\\nchildren the dose could be 10 leaves juice, 2-3 times a day.\\r\\n3. Kumari (Aleo Vera)\\r\\nKumari (Aloe) is a garden plant. In wounds, we\\r\\ncan appear aloe in place of a medicated\\r\\ndressing. Take a piece of aloe about the size\\r\\nof the wound. Cut it into a slice. Clean the\\r\\nwound with water. Apply the aloe slice on it\\r\\nand tie up with a clean cloth bandage. Change\\r\\n60 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nthe dressings everyday. It heals faster. It is very useful for burns treatment\\r\\nas dressings.\\r\\nKumari is used in several Ayurvedic preparations. It is useful for liver disorders\\r\\nand women’s illnesses like pain in the periods. It is also used for dandruff and\\r\\nfor the growth of hair.\\r\\nYou can grow kumari in your garden and ask people to grow in the kitchen\\r\\ngarden. It is hardy plant and stays for years.\\r\\n4. Adusa (Adhotoda Vacica)\\r\\nAdusa is small shrub grown for fencing. It is good remedy for\\r\\ncoughs. Use fresh\\r\\njuice or decoction of leaves. Fresh juice of leaves is used\\r\\nwith honey. It is useful for bleeding disorders eg. Blood\\r\\nin cough, blood in stools, urine etc.\\r\\nTake 50-60 gms of adusa leaves and wash them clean.\\r\\nSlow boil the leaves in one liter of water for half an hour.\\r\\nAbout one fourth water should be left. This is adusa Kawatha for coughs.\\r\\nCool and filter it. Give 20 ml once, 2-3 times a day for three days. One can\\r\\nadd sugar or honey as per requirement.\\r\\n5. Kuda (Holerrhena antidysenterica)\\r\\nThis is a forest tree with typical fruits. The fruit is black in color when fully\\r\\nripe. The fruit is like thin doubledrumstick but in twins. The bark or cover\\r\\nof the tree-stem is used for medicine. This is a good medicine for loose\\r\\nmotions and dysentery. You can simply groind a piece of\\r\\nbark and mix with a spoon of honey and give as\\r\\nmedicine. Kadha (Kawatha) also is useful. For\\r\\nthis take a 10 gm (2 teaspoon full) of bark\\r\\npowder, add one glass (200 ml) of water and\\r\\nboil. Boil it till ¼ water remain. Cool\\r\\nand bottle it. For an adult 20 ml kadha\\r\\n(Kawatha) for 3 times a day is useful to\\r\\nstop dysentry.\\r\\n61HOME REMEDIES\\r\\nSome simple home remedies\\r\\nHaldi (turmeric) is a powder of a root. It is widely\\r\\nused in our country in food as spice and as\\r\\nmedicine. Its medicinal antiseptic properties are\\r\\nknown since hundreds of years. For bleeding\\r\\nwounds press with Haldi powder to stop it.\\r\\nHaldi also has great wound healing properties.\\r\\nPeople use haldi with oil for cuts and abrasions.\\r\\nThis is good practice. The practice is to apply it with\\r\\nmilk and chana dal flour (besan) at the time of bath, as\\r\\nUBTAN to improve complexion.\\r\\nTriphala is a very useful combination of three fruits:\\r\\nAamla, Hirda, and Beheda. We can use the triphala\\r\\npowder in constipation. It is useful to reduce\\r\\nobesity and diabetes. Its external application is\\r\\nvery useful for healing wounds. Triphala powder\\r\\ncan applied on skin at the time of bath. Its\\r\\ndecoction is useful for gargling in illnesses such\\r\\nas sore throat, Stomatitis, and bleeding gums.\\r\\nTriphala powder is also used as tooth powder and\\r\\nvision disorders.\\r\\nOil massage is good for pain in the joints. Medicines may still be necessary for\\r\\njoint pains. Sesame oil or coconut oil are considered good for massage. Massage\\r\\nimprove blood circulation in the skin.\\r\\nMulethi is very a useful plant. It is available as\\r\\nsmall dry sticks. The stem is used to improve\\r\\nvoice if it is hoarse. It is given with honey.\\r\\nMulethi powder is useful in cough and hyper\\r\\nacidity . It improves the brain function\\r\\nwhen given with cow\'s milk. It is also used\\r\\nin pitta disorders-because Mulethi has\\r\\ncooling properties.\\r\\nMulethi is used as an external application to improve skin\\r\\nglow.

(food\\r\\nnot allowed) and Pathyas (and food allowed) as per our tradition of\\r\\nAyurveda advice.\\r\\n\\u0002 Plants have no side effects.\\r\\n63HOME REMEDIES\\r\\nPreventing Unwanted\\r\\nPregnancies\\r\\nChildbearing affects women’s health\\r\\nEarly marriage and teenage pregnancy is damaging to a woman’s health in\\r\\nseveral ways. It leads to abortions, premature births, risky childbirth, small baby,\\r\\nand subsequent effects on the family. It takes away the joy of living,\\r\\nprematurely. Girls tend to drop out from school due to early marriage. We can\\r\\nstop early child marriages by creating awareness in community. Talk about laws\\r\\nagainst child marriage.\\r\\nRepeated pregnancies cause anemia, cancer cervix and prolapse\\r\\nof uterus. Repeated childbearing causes a woman lot of stress.\\r\\nHer health deteriorates.\\r\\nAbortions are best avoided, except when essential. We will\\r\\nknow about termination of pregnancies in other books.\\r\\nUnsafe abortions through illegal providers (quack or doctor)\\r\\nare riskier than childbirth. Abortions can also cause infection\\r\\nand sterility. In India abortion is legal and can be obtained on\\r\\nspecified grounds.\\r\\nAbortion is available at recognised MTP centers on specified\\r\\nreasons such as Danger to life or risk to physical and mental\\r\\n18\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nThe links between childbearing\\r\\nand women’s health.\\r\\nHow abortions can also be\\r\\nharmful and can be avoided.\\r\\nCouples have unmet needs of\\r\\ncontraception to meet.\\r\\nThe couple’s options deciding\\r\\nnumber of children needs to\\r\\nbe respected.\\r\\nhealth of woman, Pregnancy on account of rape and When there is risk that\\r\\nchild is born will suffer from deformities and diseases.\\r\\nHowever, selection of sex of foetus is illegal and abortion should not be sought\\r\\neliminating female fetuses.\\r\\nContraceptive needs\\r\\nMany couple don’t want more children.They also want some years gap between\\r\\nchildren They are not using contraceptives for various reasons. You can help\\r\\nthem in meeting their contraceptive needs. Planned pregnancies and births can\\r\\nadd to the joy of life. Couples can plan it with help of safe days and other\\r\\ncontraceptive methods. Spacing between two children keeps mother and\\r\\nchildren healthy.\\r\\nContraception methods are available to prevent and space pregnancies.\\r\\nPreventing unwanted births is a right of every woman and couple. We should\\r\\ntry and meet this unmet need.\\r\\nReversible contraceptive methods\\r\\nWe have temporary (reversible) and permanent contraceptive (sterilization)\\r\\nmethods. In the next chapter we will talk about condoms for men.\\r\\nUse of condom by the husband is the easiest options for spacing between\\r\\ntwo children. Condom is a rubber balloon available at PHC or SC Health\\r\\nworkers, or at the common village shops. You will also have condoms in your\\r\\nkits. It prevents entry of seeds present in semen. Condoms also prevents\\r\\ninfections in genital tract of women and men. Condom should be removed\\r\\ncarefully after each intercourse to avoid leakage. If not used properly this\\r\\nmethod may fail.\\r\\nIuD is a device used for spacing. It is inserted in the uterus. Doctor or nurse\\r\\nputs an IUD in uterus after proper examination. This method is most\\r\\nreliable. Proper selection of a woman is necessary for IUD. There are\\r\\nother temporary contraceptives available for regulating interval between\\r\\ntwo births.\\r\\nOral pills: woman has to take one tablet daily for 28 days. Injectable\\r\\ncontraceptives are also available with private practitioners. We will know about\\r\\nthese methods soon.\\r\\n65PREVENTING UNWANTED REGNANCIES\\r\\nChoices in matter of Contraception:\\r\\nGovernment policy does not promote any specific method for contraception.\\r\\nEach women and couple has to decide about particular contraceptive method\\r\\nbased on their reproductive intentions and preferences, after analyzing\\r\\ninformation about contraceptives and matching their own preferences. You can\\r\\ncounsel the couples about contraceptive methods.\\r\\nAs ASHA, you should counsel couples about available contraceptive\\r\\nmethods. You can also get more information about contraceptives from\\r\\nnursedidi and doctor.\\r\\nThink about this:\\r\\n\\u0002 Abortion is good family planning method.\\r\\n\\u0002 Decision about family planning method should be left with the\\r\\nnursedidi/doctor.\\r\\n\\u0002 Government should give incentives for those accepting sterilisation.\\r\\n66 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nUse of Condoms:\\r\\nCondoms provide protection against unwanted\\r\\npregnancy and sexually transmitted\\r\\ninfections including HIV/AIDS.

Use a flip\\r\\nchart and a condom piece. Sometimes you will have to show it to the woman\\r\\nand ask her to share it with the man. You may use a banana (as a penis model)\\r\\nfor demonstrating it.\\r\\nMany brands are available in market. Some brands have a soft grainy surface to\\r\\nenhance pleasure. More expensive brands are also available in different colours\\r\\nand fragrance.\\r\\nSome myths and misconceptions about condoms need to be answered. The\\r\\nmisconceptions are: a) Condoms reduce pleasure of sex b) A condom user is a\\r\\npromiscuous person.\\r\\nThe female condom is now available in cities. With this even women can use a\\r\\ncondom. That is helpful when men are unwilling to put on condom. It empowers\\r\\nwomen in risky sex situations.\\r\\nThink about this:\\r\\n\\u0002 Free condoms are not of “good” quality.\\r\\n\\u0002 Nursedididi always talk about sterilizations of women.\\r\\n\\u0002 Men can’t use condoms properly under the influence of alcohol.\\r\\n68 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nRegistration of\\r\\nPregnant Women\\r\\nPregnancies\\r\\nChildbirth is a natural event. However many women can suffer and die due\\r\\nto complications during pregnancy or delivery. Any pregnancy can be\\r\\ndangerous for a mother. We can not foresee all these problems. Treated in\\r\\ntime, we can ensure safety of mother and child. Regular check ups during\\r\\npregnancy are necessary.\\r\\nAnemia in pregnant women is a major contributor to\\r\\nmothers’ deaths. Half the women have anemia. Some of them\\r\\nare very pale.

Hence,\\r\\nit is important that all pregnancies are registered and good care is available\\r\\nto them.\\r\\nRegistration will allow nursedidi to conduct regular checkups and talk to her on\\r\\nissues related to her own health and health of growing baby inside. Encourage\\r\\nwomen to register themselves for Anti-natal care as soon as they are sure of\\r\\npregnancy. A pregnancy test is available at PHC or at other health facilities.\\r\\nInvariably one day is fixed at each anganwadi centre as health day. You should\\r\\naccompany pregnancy women especially from poor sections of community.\\r\\nEncourage women to follow advice given by nursedidi during pregnancy\\r\\ncheck ups.\\r\\nEvery women need to undergo four checkups during pregnancy.\\r\\nYou have tablets for prevention of anaemia in your drug kit. These tablets can\\r\\nbe given to pregnant women, if she has not received from nursedidi.\\r\\nWhat do you think:\\r\\n\\u0002 Many women feel that pregnancy check up is waste of time.\\r\\n\\u0002 Nursedidi does not came in time at centre and women have to wait\\r\\nquite long.\\r\\n\\u0002 There is no privacy at AWC for abdominal examination.\\r\\n\\u0002 Many women go to private doctor for ANC?\\r\\n70 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nJanani Suraksha Yojana\\r\\nIt has been estimated that nearly 1,20,000 women in India\\r\\ndie each year due to pregnancy related complications. Most\\r\\nof these deaths are preventable by timely management of\\r\\ncomplications during pregnancy, child birth and immediately\\r\\nafter birth.\\r\\nChild birth is safer at a hospital equipped with all facilities to\\r\\ntreat complications during pregnancy. Many women deliver\\r\\nat home due to several reasons. Also families find it difficult\\r\\nto arrange merely for transport and buying medicines or pay doctors fee etc.\\r\\nGovernment of India has started a new scheme Janani Suraksha Yojana for\\r\\nwomen belonging to Below Poverty Line (BPL).

Sex with multiple\\r\\npartners without condom is the risky sexual behaviour. Men having sex with\\r\\nmen also exposes them to risk of infection.\\r\\nThe window period\\r\\nAfter exposure to risky situations, HIV test will be positive only after 6-12\\r\\nweeks. This is the window period. So one has to wait for this period to get an\\r\\nHIV test.\\r\\nIn our country more than 85 percent of HIV transmissions take place through\\r\\nsexual route. There are not “high risk groups” but there are some people who\\r\\nhave high risk behaviour. AIDS can strike anybody depending on your behaviour.\\r\\nAIDS is the illness\\r\\nAIDS is the illness due to HIV infection. This may take months and years after\\r\\nHIV test is positive.

HIV and AIDS is an example.\\r\\n\\u0002 Should HIV test be done before every marriage?\\r\\n\\u0002 People in city only indulge in having sex with multiple partners\\r\\n75HIV AND AIDS\\r\\nBreast feeding –It is important to share this advice\\r\\nwith mothers\\r\\nImmediate breast feeding within half an hour after birth is vital for the baby. It\\r\\ngives baby nutrition and immunity against illnesses. It shrinks the mother’s\\r\\nwomb and reduce bleeding. Milk flow is better with frequent suckling.\\r\\nBreast milk is the best food for the baby till 6 months. No other feeds including\\r\\nwater are necessary. Consult a Nursedidi if a mother has any breastfeeding\\r\\nproblem even after your help.\\r\\nMother’s breasts get prepared for producing milk during pregnancy. On delivery\\r\\nthe breasts are ready to secrete thick milk called colostrum. The baby should be\\r\\nfed with colostrum as it protects the baby from germ-attacks. This should not\\r\\nbe thrown away.\\r\\nBreast milk provides for all the needs of the baby. It also\\r\\ncontains sufficient water for the baby’s needs. No need for\\r\\nfeeding water separately. More the baby suckles, the more\\r\\nmilk is produced.\\r\\nBreast Feeding\\r\\n23\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nThe importance of\\r\\nbreastfeeding a baby.\\r\\nBasics of brestfeeding\\r\\nIt protects the baby from getting diarrhea\\r\\nand pneumonia.\\r\\nBreastfed babies normally feed every\\r\\ntwo hours. Well fed babies sleep\\r\\nquietly for 2-3 hours, and gain weight\\r\\nnormally.\\r\\nBreastfeeding postpones mother’s\\r\\nmenstrual cycle. Hence many of them do\\r\\nnot get pregnant soon. You will learn about\\r\\ncontraceptive effects of breast feeding in the\\r\\nprogramme.\\r\\nHelp for problems like cracked and sore nipples, painful breasts due to\\r\\nmilk hold up. If the nipples are sunken the baby can not suckle well.\\r\\nMothers need to be reassured about their breastfeeding abilities and that baby\\r\\ngets adequate nutrition. Breastfeeding can prevent more than 10 lacs child\\r\\ndeaths each year. Breastfeeding should be continued whenever possible for at\\r\\nleast two years.\\r\\nBreastfeeding basics-help the mother to breastfeed\\r\\n\\u0002 Clean the nipple of the breast with warm water before feed.\\r\\n\\u0002 Hold the baby horizontal on the lap or besides if the mother is lying on side.\\r\\n\\u0002 Hold the breast at the root of the nipple. Put the baby’s mouth to the\\r\\nbreast. The baby gets a full hold of the nipple now. This is evident from the\\r\\nbaby’s upturned lips.\\r\\n\\u0002 Make sure the baby’s head and body is held facing the\\r\\nbreast without turn and twist.\\r\\n\\u0002 Support the baby’s head with one hand.\\r\\n\\u0002 Clean the nipple after the baby leaves the breast.\\r\\n\\u0002 Change the side for the next feed.\\r\\n\\u0002 For a cracked nipple help the mother to massage\\r\\nher breasts gently, applying turmeric with edible\\r\\n77BREAST FEEDING\\r\\noil to nipples in such conditions. A plastic nipple\\r\\nis very useful in this situation.\\r\\nFor sunken nipples pull them out gently\\r\\nand often by hand. Place a soft rubber\\r\\nnipple-shield directly over the retracted\\r\\nor sore nipple for the baby to suck on.\\r\\nThis helps the baby to breast feed. It also\\r\\nhelps in bringing out the nipple.\\r\\nClean the nipple shield thoroughly before\\r\\nand after every feeding.\\r\\nSome mothers get dribbling from the other breast if the baby is on one\\r\\nbreast. But this is not a rule. No need to worry if dribbling is happening\\r\\nor not.\\r\\nThink about this\\r\\n\\u0002 Often a baby is breastfed only after the third day. This starves the\\r\\nbaby and affects the milk flow.\\r\\n\\u0002 Pre lacteal foods are given to many new born babies. Are these\\r\\nany good?\\r\\n\\u0002 Many babies are breast fed for 3 year.\\r\\n\\u0002 Many mothers are not sure if her baby is being fed adequately and\\r\\nhence they resort to top feeding.\\r\\n78 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nChild feeding practices after six months\\r\\n\\u0002 After six months of only breast feeding, the baby needs extra food to grow.\\r\\nStart one new food type at a time, not many.\\r\\n\\u0002 Food like gruel, porridge, cooked vegetable, fruit pulp is\\r\\ngood for babies after six months age. If top milk is given do\\r\\nnot dilute it. Dilute milk is often the cause of malnutrition.\\r\\n\\u0002 Prepare semi solid feeds from roasted, puffed grain, flour\\r\\nprepared from fermented grain (satva) are easy to digest.\\r\\n\\u0002 Add oil or ghee to child’s food to improve nutrition.\\r\\n\\u0002 Eggs are a good source of body building element\\r\\ncalled proteins.\\r\\n\\u0002 Babies and children need frequent feeds every day. Child\\r\\nshould be offered food every three to four hours.\\r\\n\\u0002 Washing hands before preparing food and feeding child is essential.\\r\\n\\u0002 For older children (2 years) keep food ready and reachable for the child. The\\r\\nchild should it eat whenever hungry e.g. Roasted groundnuts and Jaggery\\r\\n(gud) are popular.\\r\\n\\u0002 Eggs, groundnut, Soyabeans, fish are high protein foods.

Maternal hygiene needs to\\r\\nbe promoted.\\r\\nThink about this\\r\\n\\u0002 Many parents give top feed only after the baby is 1year old.\\r\\n\\u0002 Girl babies get less attention and feeds from male children.\\r\\n\\u0002 Who feeds children when parents go to work?\\r\\n80 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nSome home recipes for child feeding children\\r\\nRice and dal Khichdi with ghee or oil–\\r\\nPorridge – semolina (suji / rawa), singhada, Ragi flour, Hyderabad mix\\r\\n(preparation of Hyderabad mix –  one katori rice, half katori chana dal, one-forth\\r\\nkatori ground nut to be roasted and powdered.)\\r\\nCooked vegetables – spinach, pumpkin, carrots, potato, beans, tomato\\r\\nFruit pulp of banana, papaya, apple, chikku, and mango\\r\\nImmunization\\r\\nWe should know this–\\r\\nMany serious germ diseases in children can be prevented by\\r\\nimmunization vaccines\\r\\nBCG prevents Lung TB.\\r\\nOPV (Polio dose) prevents Polio.\\r\\nDPT protects the child from Diphtheria, whooping cough and Tetanus.\\r\\nMeasles vaccine prevents measles.\\r\\nThese vaccines are given free to all children by the\\r\\nnurse didi in your village. They are also given at the\\r\\nsub centers and the PHC.\\r\\nVaccines need cold storage during transportation to\\r\\nretain their power.\\r\\nChild gets fever after DPT injections. This can be treated\\r\\nwith ‘Paracetomol’ tablet or liquid.\\r\\n25\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nVaccines for six dangerous\\r\\nillnesses of childhood.\\r\\nImportance of Vit A doses\\r\\nTo convince parents to take\\r\\ntheir children for\\r\\nimmunization.\\r\\nBCG is usually injected on the baby’s left\\r\\nshoulder. A scar is formed six weeks after\\r\\ninjection. It shows that the child may have\\r\\nbecome immune to Lung TB.\\r\\nGive also five doses of vitamin A. Start\\r\\nfrom nine months age, and give every six\\r\\nmonths. This protects children from night\\r\\nblindness. Vit A also boosts child’s\\r\\nimmunity against germs.\\r\\nWe all know that many parents deny their\\r\\nchildren immunization. Immunization boosts body’s fighting power\\r\\nagainst diseases caused by germs. You can help them by explaining\\r\\nbenefits of immunization. Accompany them during immunization\\r\\nservices in village.\\r\\n82 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nName of vaccine When to give\\r\\nBCG At birth or any time up to one year\\r\\nPolio - 0 At birth (if delivery is in institution)\\r\\nPolio – 1+DPT 6 weeks\\r\\nPolio – 2+DPT 10 weeks\\r\\nPolio – 3+DPT 14 weeks\\r\\nMeasles+ Vit A (1ml) Nine months\\r\\n1st Booster DPT & Polio +Vit A 2ml 18 months\\r\\nVit A 2ml 24 months\\r\\nVit A 2ml 30 months\\r\\nVit A 2ml 36 months\\r\\nIf a child is not given the right vaccines in time, get them started whenever possible\\r\\nand complete the primary immunization before child reaches first birthday.\\r\\nSchedule for immunization & Vit A:\\r\\n83IMMUNIZATION\\r\\nMake sure\\r\\nImmunization card is given for each child by the health\\r\\nworker and to be kept safely for further follow up. The\\r\\nchild gets full immunization in time. Parents should\\r\\nbring the child for immunization as per schedule.\\r\\nOnly complete immunization protects the child fully.\\r\\nPartial immunization does not protect and gives false\\r\\nsense of protection.\\r\\nSome people have misconceptions about\\r\\nimmunization. You need to dispel these. For instance\\r\\nsome people feel that immunization is harmful to babies. Or\\r\\nit causes fever and therefore illness. Another misconception is that\\r\\nimmunization should not be done if the child is sick. Ask your nursedidi\\r\\nabout questions raised by the parents about immunization.\\r\\nWhat do you think about this?\\r\\n\\u0002 People feel that quality of vaccines offered in villages is not good.\\r\\n\\u0002 Some people feel that despite complete immunization children get Polio?\\r\\nWhy does diarrhea occur?\\r\\nMany children get diarrhea in your village. One or two among may have even\\r\\ndied due to the illness. Germs are the main cause of childhood diarrhea.\\r\\nThese germs come from unsafe drinking water, unclean feeding practices,\\r\\nbottle feeds etc. We can avoid these problems with help of families and the\\r\\nvillage community.\\r\\nWhat happens to child with diarrhea?\\r\\nWater makes up to 72-75 percent of children’s body weight. That makes life\\r\\npossible. What if we lose even some water? Think of a plant without water. We\\r\\nhave a pretty flower plant in our house. We forgot to water the plant. We know\\r\\nwhat would happen to it!\\r\\nWater loss can be fatal. Whatever the germ of diarrhea, the\\r\\ndehydration is the cause of deaths. You have to act in time.\\r\\nLet us understand the stages of water loss.\\r\\nRehydration\\r\\nTreatment of diarrhea is very easy and quite effective.\\r\\nThe principle is to prevent dehydration.(loose motions\\r\\nmay not stop for 2-3 days) Water needs to be restored\\r\\nquickly. Continue feeding. If child is breast feeding, it\\r\\nshould continue.\\r\\nDiarrhoea\\r\\n26\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nWhat causes diarrhea.\\r\\nHow diarrhea can be fatal?\\r\\nHow severe is the\\r\\ndehydration.\\r\\nHow can we save such\\r\\nchildren at home?\\r\\nHome Available Fluids (HAF)\\r\\nGive the baby a lot of watery foods like ‘Sharbat’, coconut water, rice-kanji,\\r\\nlight tea etc. You should talk about commonly available, locally accepted\\r\\nliquids which are given to children.\\r\\nOral Rehydration Salt (ORS)\\r\\nORS packets are available in your kit and with other health workers.\\r\\nTake one liter of water in a clean container. Empty the full packet of ORS in\\r\\nthis. Stir it. Start giving this fluid spoon by spoon to the child. Prepare fresh\\r\\nORS everyday.\\r\\nOther tips\\r\\n\\u0002 Mother/father or other care taker, should wash hand properly before\\r\\nfeeding the baby. It should not give new infection.\\r\\n\\u0002 Give ORS spoon by spoon to avoid vomiting.\\r\\n\\u0002 If possible, use boiled water for preparing ORS.

Under\\r\\nnutrition, weak immunity,\\r\\novercrowding and poor living\\r\\nconditions etc. help Tuberculosis\\r\\nspread.\\r\\nTB\\r\\n28\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nCause of Tuberculosis\\r\\nSuspecting Tuberculosis\\r\\nReferral to health facility for\\r\\ndiagnosis and treatment.\\r\\nWe have good drugs for TB today than we had before.\\r\\nSuspecting TB\\r\\nA person suffering from TB has one or more of these symptoms.\\r\\n\\u0002 The most common symptom of TB is cough lasting 3 or more weeks.\\r\\n\\u0002 Sputum cough\\r\\n\\u0002 Evening fever with sweating,\\r\\n\\u0002 The patient may also have chest pain.\\r\\n\\u0002 Coughing up blood. (Bloodspit)\\r\\nHowever, the following four points are important for suspected TB cases.\\r\\n\\u0002 Diagnosis needs checking patient’s sputum under microscope.\\r\\n\\u0002 Escort the patient to nearest CHC/PHC, where facilities are available.\\r\\n\\u0002 No fees are charged for any tests or the treatment.\\r\\n\\u0002 AIDS patients can also have TB.\\r\\nCure for TB\\r\\nVery effective cure for TB is available. One has to take the medicines in\\r\\nfront of ANM or MPW or any health provider. This is called directly\\r\\nobserved treatment (DOT). The improvement occurs in a few weeks.\\r\\nHowever, the full treatment takes 6 to 8 months in most cases. Our rule is\\r\\nto make the patient complete the full treatment. You can also be a\\r\\nprovider for DOTs treatment to TB patients in your village. Try to get more\\r\\ninformation above DOTs treatment from nursedidi or male worker. During\\r\\ntreatment the sputum is tested periodically for germs of TB. Remember\\r\\nthat services are available free!\\r\\nSome precautions\\r\\n\\u0002 One should cover the mouth with handkerchief while coughing and\\r\\nsneezing. This halts spread of germs.\\r\\n\\u0002 One should take the medicines regularly. Keep a follow up for this.\\r\\n\\u0002 Persons having TB should avoid close contact with young children.\\r\\n\\u0002 Children should get BCG vaccine in time that prevents serious forms\\r\\nof TB.\\r\\n90 READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA \\r\\nWe can do this\\r\\nFind persons who may be suffering from TB. Look who is getting cough for more\\r\\nthan 3 weeks. Take the person to health center for sputum test. Tell TB patients\\r\\nto take medicines regularly. Encourage them to complete the treatment. Tell\\r\\npeople all tests and treatment is free at all government hospitals. Even private\\r\\ndoctors can arrange DOTS treatment.\\r\\nInform people that BCG vaccine prevents TB. All children should get BCG\\r\\nvaccine as per national schedule.\\r\\nEducate patients to cover their mouth while coughing and sneezing. Also tell\\r\\nthem not to spit here and there.\\r\\nWhat do you think about this?\\r\\n\\u0002 Some people say TB is incurable disease.\\r\\n\\u0002 TB patients must eat eggs everyday to recover.\\r\\n\\u0002 Why some patients of TB stop treatment before completion?\\r\\n\\u0002 Why patients go to private doctors though government gives\\r\\nfree treatment?\\r\\n\\u0002 Many TB patients don’t like to take anti-TB drugs due to side effects.\\r\\n91TB\\r\\nSome useful information\\r\\nMost snakebites are non-poisonous. Snakebites are common in rainy seasons\\r\\nand night hours.\\r\\nTwo-fang marks are typical of a poisonous snakebite. Look for fang marks. It is\\r\\neasy to know the 4 common poisonous snakes. Cobra, krait, big viper and the\\r\\nsmall viper are the four main harmful snakes.\\r\\nEffective and quick first aid can save most patients. No magic or\\r\\ntemple prayers can undo the poison bites. The 90% cases are\\r\\nsaved because the bite was non-poisonous. Panic can\\r\\nalso kill.\\r\\nDrooping eyes or bleeding are first signs of poison.\\r\\nDrooping eyelids or sleepiness point to cobra and krait bites.\\r\\nBleeding from bite, gums, urine, in vomit means viper bite.\\r\\nSnake Bite\\r\\n29\\r\\nIn this lesson we will\\r\\nlearn about\\r\\nHow to identify poisonous\\r\\nbite\\r\\nWhat is the correct first aid\\r\\nfor snakebite?\\r\\nFirst aid in any snake bite\\r\\nReassure the person and the family. Tell them it may be non-poisonous. Make\\r\\nthe person lie down and relax. Do not make patient walk. . In case of non\\r\\npoisonous snake bite, it s enough to clean and disinfect the wound.\\r\\nTie the entire limb with an elastic bandage. This slows blood flow from the limb.\\r\\nThen tie a stick to the limb to lessen movement.\\r\\nShift to the nearest hospital. Keep looking for poison signs of drooping or\\r\\nbleeding. Take along the snake if it is brought killed. This helps in\\r\\ntreatment. Now specific anti snake venous infections are available. You\\r\\nshould know about the hospitals where anti snake venom drugs are\\r\\navailable in your area.\\r\\nMany people kill snakes indiscriminately. This is not good. Snakes eats\\r\\nrodents which causes loss of our food grains. And many of them are\\r\\nnon-poisonous.\\r\\nDon\'ts\\r\\n\\u0002 Do not waste valuable time in a temple or with a Tantrik. Remember even\\r\\nsome Tantriks have died due to snakebite.\\r\\n\\u0002 Do not tie a tourniquet (single band string as was practiced till sometime\\r\\nago). This causes the bite to bleed and may also stop blood flow to the limb.\\r\\nMore than 2 hours to tight tourniquet can cause blackening and then loss\\r\\nof the limb.\\r\\n\\u0002 Do not kill and waste chickens as some villagers do to treat snake bite.\\r\\nWhat do you think about this?\\r\\n\\u0002 Some people kill every snake they see.\\r\\n\\u0002 Snakes eat up rats and save our food grain.\\r\\n\\u0002 Snakes remember and identify a person.\\r\\n\\u0002 Snakes also take revenge.\\r\\n93SNAKE BITE\\r\\nMedicines Action & use Dose Side Effects\\r\\nParacetomol Reduces More than 12 years: 1 to 2 No side effects.\\r\\nfever and 1tablet 3 to 4 times a day If taken too many \\r\\npain: useful 8 to 12 years: 1 tablet 3 to tablets at one time, it\\r\\nin fever, 4 times a day can cause damage to \\r\\nheadaches, 4 to 8 years: ½ tablet 3 to 4 liver.

Many illnesses spread due to lack of cleanliness. Illnesses like diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, worms, typhoid, skin infections, louse infestations and dental problems etc are examples\\n\\n\\n\\nToilet practices\\nIn India many people go to open fields for defecation. You need to help them in getting sanitary latrines installed. These are convenient for young girls, women, aged, sick person and children who often find it difficult to go to fields. You will get more information about construction of sanitary latrines from the block Panchayat office. After defecation, most use water-wash for anal clean up. This soils the hand with germs. It is necessary to wash the hands thoroughly after this, with soap or ash. Some people use paper or leaves of some trees for anal clean up. This may be actually healthier as avoids soiling of hands with germs.\\n\\nHand wash\\nMany diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid etc are caused due to germs present on dirty hands. You should ensure that your hands are clean, especially before eating any food. Wash your hands with plain water first and then with soap and see the difference in wash water. You will appreciate the difference. After going to the toilet and before having meal, we must wash our hands thoroughly.\\n\\nWash the hands with a lot of water first. Apply soap or ashes and rub on the hands particularly the nails, tip of the fingers and between them. Again, pour water. Dry it with a clean piece of cloth or napkin.\\n\\nCutting nails regularly removes space for collection of dirt. Long nails may be fashionable but also hide germs, if not properly cleaned.\\n\\nOur Mouth and teeth\\nOur teeth remain healthy if we clean them everyday. Food particles collect in the tooth gaps. This leads to tooth problems and swollen gums.\\n\\nWe must have a good mouthwash after each meal. This will remove food particles and prevent the problems of tooth and gums. Just imagine what happens to a utensil, which was used for cooking food last night and not cleaned overnight. It stinks badly. Similarly if we don’t clean our mouth after meals it will also stink. Never have a bed-tea without mouthwash.\\n\\nDiscourage use of raw or burnt tobacco for cleaning teeth. That causes stains. Smoking also makes teeth dirty.\\n\\nUse of ash is good, but it cannot clean the gaps.\\n\\nRegular tooth brushing will remove the plaque\\nUse a soft bristled brush. Be sure it is the right size (a smaller is better than a big one).\\n\\nPlace the brush angled to the teeth. Brush the teeth toward the gums. Brush very gently so that any plaque growing under the gum will be removed. Brush the outside, the tongue side and the chewing surfaces of your teeth. Brushing tongue will make your breath odorless. Stale food and germs can collect on your tongue and cause bad breath. Brush at least twice every day, before and after sleep. This would prevent plaque formation.\\n\\nBrushing too vigorously or using a hard brush may cause damage to gums.\\n\\nChange the brush if the bristles look spread. A worn out toothbrush will not clean our teeth.\\n\\nToothpaste is not always necessary for brushing. Therefore brushing is a cheap way to keep the teeth and gums healthy.\\n\\nDatoun\\nPeople in the village often use datoun, a 8-10 inches long and small finger thick twig of neem, babool or Karanj etc. This practice is good. After chewing the twig a bit, the end becomes bristly. The bristles can clean gaps between teeth. The medicinal properties of datoun keep the gums healthy. Datoun should not\\n\\n\\n\\nne used if there are any ulcers in the mouth. Gargles with lukewarm water are good for mouthwash after meals and particulars after eating sweet foods.\\n\\nDaily bath\\nOur culture regards daily bath as a ritual. It is indeed necessary in hot weather as sweating makes us dirty. (In very cold regions one may skip daily baths.) Use water economically. Some people like hot water. Massage with warm sesame or mustard oil is good before bath. Temperature of bath water should be neither too hot not too cold. After retiring from daily work, we should wash feet, hands and face with water to remove dirt and sweat.\\n\\nClean cloth\\nClothes with comfortable fitting be used according to season. Cotton clothes of light colour are more comfortable in summers and warm clothes in winters. Our undergarments and other clothes must be clean to keep away skin infections and louse infestation. A daily change is healthy practice.\\n\\nHair care\\nCombing the hair everyday is necessary for its health. A head-bath is necessary especially if your hair stinks due to sweating. Mixture of Shikakai, Reetha and Amla soaked in water is a simple, cheap and safe way for washing oily and sticky hair. For louse, we need fine combs. Avoid using somebody else’s comb as it may have louse.\\n\\nFootwear\\nProper footwear is necessary to keep away germs and worms in the dust from getting onto your feet. Many people walk or children play barefooted in the fields. Sometimes these fields are also used for defecation. The worms present in the faeces may get entry in the body when we walk bare footed. You will learn more about these worms in subsequent books. Dusty and hot weather also cracks our soles. Some people buy shoes, only to use them during festivals or when going out to meet their friends and relatives. This is not good. The Indian custom of keeping footwear outside the house is good. Everyone including children should always wear shoes when going outside their houses. Shoes are necessary for those who get cracked heal.\\n\\nWhat do you think?\\nLong nails come handy when some one is attacking you physically.\\nOne can remove food particles in between teeth by needles.\\nLack of privacy for bath is a cause of skin illnesses.\\n\\n\\n\"}]}', NULL, '{\"plan_text_in_markdown_format\":\"1. single_correct_questions: 2 questions (1 EASY, 1 MEDIUM)\\\\n2. multiple_correct_questions: 2 questions (1 EASY, 1 DIFFICULT)\\\\n3. short_answer_questions: 1 question (MEDIUM)\\\\n4. long_answer_questions: 1 question (DIFFICULT)\\\\n5. fill_up_blanks: 1 question (EASY)\\\\n6. true_false_questions: 1 question (MEDIUM)\\\\n7. match_the_following: 2 questions (1 EASY, 1 MEDIUM)\",\"assessment_title\":\"Personal Hygiene Assessment\",\"assessment_description\":\"This assessment evaluates your understanding of the importance of personal hygiene including practices like hand washing, teeth cleaning, nail grooming, bathing, and the use of clean clothes and footwear.\",\"single_correct_questions\":[{\"number\":\"01/10\",\"question\":\"What is a major health benefit of cutting nails regularly?\",\"choices\":[\"Removes space for dirt collection\",\"Looks fashionable\",\"Strengthens the nails\",\"Promotes faster nail growth\"],\"correct_answer_text\":\"Removes space for dirt collection\",\"explanation\":\"Cutting nails regularly helps in removing spaces where dirt and germs can accumulate, reducing the risk of infections.\",\"level\":\"EASY\"},{\"number\":\"02/10\",\"question\":\"Why should a toothbrush be changed if the bristles look spread?\",\"choices\":[\"It causes gum damage\",\"It cannot clean effectively\",\"It looks unattractive\",\"It is too soft\"],\"correct_answer_text\":\"It cannot clean effectively\",\"explanation\":\"A worn-out toothbrush with spread bristles is less effective at cleaning teeth and removing plaque.\",\"level\":\"MEDIUM\"}],\"multiple_correct_questions\":[{\"number\":\"03/10\",\"question\":\"Which of the following are benefits of washing hands with soap?\",\"choices\":[\"Removes germs\",\"Prevents diarrhea\",\"Cleans only visible dirt\",\"Only useful after toilet use\"],\"correct_answer_text_list\":[\"Removes germs\",\"Prevents diarrhea\"],\"explanation\":\"Washing hands with soap effectively removes germs and prevents illnesses like diarrhea, whereas it also cleans dirt whether visible or not.\",\"level\":\"EASY\"},{\"number\":\"04/10\",\"question\":\"Select the correct practices for maintaining oral hygiene.\",\"choices\":[\"Brushing teeth twice daily\",\"Using a hard-bristled brush\",\"Avoiding tobacco\",\"Skipping mouthwash after meals\"],\"correct_answer_text_list\":[\"Brushing teeth twice daily\",\"Avoiding tobacco\"],\"explanation\":\"Brushing teeth twice a day and avoiding tobacco are essential for maintaining oral health, while a soft-bristled brush is recommended and mouthwash should not be skipped.\",\"level\":\"DIFFICULT\"}],\"short_answer_questions\":[{\"number\":\"05/10\",\"question\":\"What is the role of ash in personal hygiene?\",\"short_answer\":\"Ash can be used as a cleaning agent for hands and teeth.\",\"explanation\":\"Ash is a traditional and effective cleaning agent that can be used in place of soap for handwashing or toothpaste for brushing teeth, especially in rural areas.\",\"level\":\"MEDIUM\"}],\"long_answer_questions\":[{\"number\":\"06/10\",\"question\":\"Discuss the cultural and health implications of bathing daily in different climates.\",\"long_answer\":\"Daily bathing is culturally viewed as a ritual of cleanliness and is essential in hot climates due to excessive sweating, preventing body odor and skin infections.

You should ensure that your hands are clean, especially before eating any food. Wash your hands with plain water first and then with soap and see the difference in wash water. You will appreciate the difference. After going to the toilet and before having meal, we must wash our hands thoroughly.\\n\\nWash the hands with a lot of water first. Apply soap or ashes and rub on the hands particularly the nails, tip of the fingers and between them. Again, pour water. Dry it with a clean piece of cloth or napkin.\\n\\nCutting nails regularly removes space for collection of dirt. Long nails may be fashionable but also hide germs, if not properly cleaned.\\n\\nOur Mouth and teeth\\nOur teeth remain healthy if we clean them everyday. Food particles collect in the tooth gaps. This leads to tooth problems and swollen gums.\\n\\nWe must have a good mouthwash after each meal. This will remove food particles and prevent the problems of tooth and gums. Just imagine what happens to a utensil, which was used for cooking food last night and not cleaned overnight. It stinks badly. Similarly if we don’t clean our mouth after meals it will also stink. Never have a bed-tea without mouthwash.\\n\\nDiscourage use of raw or burnt tobacco for cleaning teeth. That causes stains. Smoking also makes teeth dirty.\\n\\nUse of ash is good, but it cannot clean the gaps.\\n\\nRegular tooth brushing will remove the plaque\\nUse a soft bristled brush. Be sure it is the right size (a smaller is better than a big one).\\n\\nPlace the brush angled to the teeth. Brush the teeth toward the gums. Brush very gently so that any plaque growing under the gum will be removed. Brush the outside, the tongue side and the chewing surfaces of your teeth. Brushing tongue will make your breath odorless. Stale food and germs can collect on your tongue and cause bad breath. Brush at least twice every day, before and after sleep. This would prevent plaque formation.\\n\\nBrushing too vigorously or using a hard brush may cause damage to gums.\\n\\nChange the brush if the bristles look spread. A worn out toothbrush will not clean our teeth.\\n\\nToothpaste is not always necessary for brushing. Therefore brushing is a cheap way to keep the teeth and gums healthy.\\n\\nDatoun\\nPeople in the village often use datoun, a 8-10 inches long and small finger thick twig of neem, babool or Karanj etc. This practice is good. After chewing the twig a bit, the end becomes bristly. The bristles can clean gaps between teeth. The medicinal properties of datoun keep the gums healthy. Datoun should not\\n\\n\\n\\nne used if there are any ulcers in the mouth. Gargles with lukewarm water are good for mouthwash after meals and particulars after eating sweet foods.\\n\\nDaily bath\\nOur culture regards daily bath as a ritual. It is indeed necessary in hot weather as sweating makes us dirty. (In very cold regions one may skip daily baths.) Use water economically. Some people like hot water. Massage with warm sesame or mustard oil is good before bath. Temperature of bath water should be neither too hot not too cold. After retiring from daily work, we should wash feet, hands and face with water to remove dirt and sweat.\\n\\nClean cloth\\nClothes with comfortable fitting be used according to season. Cotton clothes of light colour are more comfortable in summers and warm clothes in winters. Our undergarments and other clothes must be clean to keep away skin infections and louse infestation. A daily change is healthy practice.\\n\\nHair care\\nCombing the hair everyday is necessary for its health. A head-bath is necessary especially if your hair stinks due to sweating. Mixture of Shikakai, Reetha and Amla soaked in water is a simple, cheap and safe way for washing oily and sticky hair. For louse, we need fine combs. Avoid using somebody else’s comb as it may have louse.\\n\\nFootwear\\nProper footwear is necessary to keep away germs and worms in the dust from getting onto your feet. Many people walk or children play barefooted in the fields. Sometimes these fields are also used for defecation. The worms present in the faeces may get entry in the body when we walk bare footed. You will learn more about these worms in subsequent books. Dusty and hot weather also cracks our soles. Some people buy shoes, only to use them during festivals or when going out to meet their friends and relatives. This is not good. The Indian custom of keeping footwear outside the house is good. Everyone including children should always wear shoes when going outside their houses. Shoes are necessary for those who get cracked heal.\\n\\nWhat do you think?\\nLong nails come handy when some one is attacking you physically.\\nOne can remove food particles in between teeth by needles.\\nLack of privacy for bath is a cause of skin illnesses.\\n\\n\\n\"}]}', NULL, '{\"plan_text_in_markdown_format\":\"- **Single Correct Questions:** 3 questions (1 EASY, 1 MEDIUM, 1 DIFFICULT)\\n- **Multiple Correct Questions:** 2 questions (1 EASY, 1 DIFFICULT)\",\"assessment_title\":\"Personal Hygiene and Cleanliness\",\"assessment_description\":\"This assessment tests your understanding of personal hygiene practices and their importance in maintaining health and preventing diseases.\",\"single_correct_questions\":[{\"number\":\"1/5\",\"question\":\"Why is it important to wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet?\",\"choices\":[\"To remove soap residue\",\"To prevent the spread of germs\",\"To dry your hands properly\",\"To cool down your hands\"],\"correct_answer_text\":\"To prevent the spread of germs\",\"explanation\":\"Handwashing removes germs that can cause illnesses such as diarrhea and typhoid.\",\"level\":\"EASY\"},{\"number\":\"2/5\",\"question\":\"What is the recommended way to brush your teeth to ensure oral health?\",\"choices\":[\"Using a hard-bristled brush vigorously\",\"Brushing gently with a soft-bristled brush\",\"Using any available stick or twig\",\"Avoiding brushing the tongue\"],\"correct_answer_text\":\"Brushing gently with a soft-bristled brush\",\"explanation\":\"A soft-bristled brush used gently prevents damage to gums and effectively removes plaque.\",\"level\":\"MEDIUM\"},{\"number\":\"3/5\",\"question\":\"What is a potential risk of not wearing proper footwear when going outside?\",\"choices\":[\"Improper posture\",\"Footwear getting dirty\",\"Increased sunburn risk\",\"Introduction of worms into the body\"],\"correct_answer_text\":\"Introduction of worms into the body\",\"explanation\":\"Walking barefoot in areas used for defecation can lead to worms entering the body.\",\"level\":\"DIFFICULT\"}],\"multiple_correct_questions\":[{\"number\":\"4/5\",\"question\":\"Which of the following practices contribute to healthy hair care?\",\"choices\":[\"Combing hair daily\",\"Sharing combs with others\",\"Using a mixture of Shikakai, Reetha, and Amla\",\"Avoiding hair washing altogether\"],\"correct_answer_text_list\":[\"Combing hair daily\",\"Using a mixture of Shikakai, Reetha, and Amla\"],\"explanation\":\"Daily combing prevents tangles and using natural mixtures helps clean and nourish hair.\",\"level\":\"EASY\"},{\"number\":\"5/5\",\"question\":\"What are some essential practices for maintaining oral hygiene?\",\"choices\":[\"Using a needle to clean teeth gaps\",\"Brushing at least twice a day\",\"Using a soft-bristled brush\",\"Skipping mouthwash after meals\"],\"correct_answer_text_list\":[\"Brushing at least twice a day\",\"Using a soft-bristled brush\"],\"explanation\":\"Regular brushing and using a soft brush ensure teeth remain clean and gums healthy.\",\"level\":\"DIFFICULT\"}]}', '2025-04-13 12:33:54.771660');

Some benefit plans, such as health insurance and dental insurance, provide for their immediate well being. Other benefit plans promise to provide financial security at retirement. There are a number of ways employers provide retirement benefits for their employees. Most employers will use defined benefit, or pension plans, and/or defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits. The most common type of defined contribution plan is the 401(k) plan.  \\nEmployers have various methods of providing retirement benefits for their employees. Today, more and more employers are asking their employees to share in the responsibility for their retirement. One of the ways employers ask employees to share the cost is through a 401(k) retirement plan. Employees can save for their retirement and also provide an immediate tax savings for themselves and their employer by participating in a 401(k) plan. A 401(k) plan participant decides, within plan limits: how much to contribute, where to invest the contributions, and how long the contributions remain in the plan.  \\nHighly Compensated Employees  \\nUnder ERISA guidelines for plan qualification, a plan may not discriminate in favor of any particular group of employees, such as highly compensated employees (HOEs). Employees are considered highly compensated if:  \\n \\nThey own 5% or more of the company, or  \\nThey have earned $90,000 or more during the previous year (effective for year 2003). For 2004, the amount will remain at $90,000. \\nQualified Plan \\nQualified plans are plans that meet strict IRS requirements. 401(k) plans are a type of qualified plan \\n \\n\\n\\n2.2 Types of Plan \\nOverview \\nEmployers who provide employees with a retirement benefit have a choice whether to use the defined benefit (DB) plan design, commonly called a pension plan or the defined contribution (DC) plan design. For many years the DB plan was the primary method used by employers to provide a retirement benefit. In recent years, employers have turned to a popular DC plan method known as a 401(k) plan. \\nSome employers offer both types of plans while others offer neither. However, most employers elect to offer at least one type of plan to receive the immediate tax & retirement benefit.  \\nDefined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution \\nDefined benefit pension plans and defined contribution savings plans are both designed to provide the employee with retirement income. Some of the common differences between the DB and DC plans are listed in the following chart.  \\n\\t \\tDefined Benefit Plan \\tDefined Contribution Plan \\nThe employer funds it. \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\tEmployee and employer contributions are allocated to individual participants. The participant may have to contribute to receive a benefit. \\nThe employer bears the investment risk. \\t \\t \\t \\tThe participant bears the investment risk. \\nIt is generally difficult to communicate.  \\t \\t \\t \\tIt is easier to communicate.  \\nThere is a definite benefit formula. \\t \\t \\t \\tThe final retirement benefit is unknown. \\nThe benefit is expressed as an annuity  payable at normal retirement age, usually  age 65.  \\t \\tThe benefit is expressed as an account balance. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nThe following plans are designated as defined contribution plans:  \\n401(k) plans \\nProfit sharing plans  \\nThrift plans  \\n403(b) and 457 plans  \\nEmployee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)  \\n \\nThe 401(k) plan is the most popular form of defined contribution plan used by employers today.  \\n \\n2.3 Eligibility  \\nOverview \\nWhen an employer decides to offer a 401(k) plan, it must determine, within ERISA guidelines who will be permitted to participate and how eligibility will be defined. Although ERISA dictates many of the parameters plans must follow it also gives employers some choices when setting eligibility requirements for 401(k) plan participation  \\nEmployers may choose to limit eligibility based on:  \\nAge:  Under ERISA, a plan may limit participation to employees age 21 and over. Plans may choose to allow participation before age 21. \\nService: The maximum service requirement a 401(k) plan can impose for eligibility to participate, by law, is one year. A plan may choose to impose a service requirement as a cost savings measure, especially in industries where there is high turnover in the first year of employment.  \\nNote: DC plans other than 401(k) plans may require two years of service for             eligibility; however, employees entering the plan after two years must be 100% vested immediately upon entering the plan.      \\nEmployment classification:  Employers may choose to only allow full-time and/or permanent employees to participate, thereby excluding part-time and/or temporary employees. \\nNo eligibility requirements: Some plans may choose to have no eligibility restrictions. In this case, all employees would have the option to begin participating immediately upon hire.  \\nService:  If an employer chooses to impose a service requirement, the plan must decide how it will calculate one year of service. ERISA allows a number of methods for calculating when one year of service has been completed including:  \\n \\n \\n                                                    \\n                                                    \\n2\\n \\nC3    -Protected \\t \\tPage 2 of 169 \\nUn-controlled when printed \\n \\n\\n1,000 Hours Method \\tElapsed Time Method \\nThe most common method is to determine if the employee has completed at least 1,000 hours of service in the 12-month period following the date of hire. \\tThis option does not count hours, only the specific length of service, such as one year from the date of hire. \\n\\n \\nEntry Dates \\nERISA allows employers to establish specific times of the year when employees can enroll in 401(k) plans. These are called entry dates. The designated enrollment dates may be quarterly, monthly, or by payroll cycle. Entry dates relieve plans from the possible administrative task of enrolling new participants on a daily basis.  \\nERISA requires that the use of entry dates may not delay entry into the plan by more than six months after the employee has met the plan‟s eligibility requirements. \\n \\n2.4 Contribution \\n401(k) plans offer employers opportunities for flexible plan design within the requirements established by (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and the Department of Labor (DOL).  401 (k) plans may be offered in several different ways with several different contribution options. Some 401(k) plans have employee contributions only and others have both employee and employer contributions. 401(k) plans may have only before-tax contributions or they may have both before- and after-tax contributions.  \\nEmployee Contributions \\nInternal Revenue Code section 401 (a) (17) limits the annual amount of pay a qualified plan may consider in calculating tax-deferred contributions or benefits. This is known as the Maximum Compensation Limit, which limits the amount of pay that is eligible for all contributions. The limit for 2004 is $205,000.  \\nThis means that an employee who earns over this amount annually will be recognized as only earning $205,000 for 401(k) plan purposes. The limit is periodically adjusted by the IRS to reflect changes in the cost of living index. \\nEmployee Before-Tax Contributions \\nDeductions taken from the employee‟s paycheck on a before-tax basis are applied before taxes are taken out of the employee‟s gross income. Only Social Security and Medicare taxes are deducted prior to any before-tax contributions. Before-tax contributions reduce the participant‟s current taxable income. Before-tax contributions are also commonly referred to as pre-tax. \\nEmployee After - Tax Contributions \\nDeductions taken from the employee‟s paycheck on an after-tax basis are applied after all taxes have been taken out of the employee‟s gross income. After-tax contributions are also commonly referred to as post-tax. \\n \\nEmployer Contributions  \\nIn addition to employees making contributions, some employers make contributions on behalf of the employees. Employers may choose to provide these contributions to encourage employee participation in the 401(k) plan and/or attract and retain skilled employees. Employer contributions are considered before-tax contributions and remain tax deferred until withdrawn. Some employers may choose to provide: \\nA matching contribution based on the contributions the participant makes ;  \\nContributions based on the annual profits of the company; \\nBoth types of employer contributions; and  Neither type of employer contributions. \\nEmployer Matching Contributions  \\nMatching contributions are usually a percentage of the participant‟s compensation and are tied to the amount the participant contributes.  \\nEmployers frequently place a limit on the amount of the match. Only employees who have chosen to contribute to the 401(k) plan receive matching contributions.  \\nEmployer Discretionary Contributions \\nDiscretionary contributions can be provided in addition to, or instead of, employer matching contributions. One example of a discretionary contribution is a profit sharing contribution. \\nDiscretionary contributions may change each year and are generally tied to annual profits. \\n\\tEmployers \\tmay \\toffer \\tdiscretionary \\tcontributions \\tone \\tyear \\tand \\tnone \\tthe \\tnext. \\nDiscretionary contributions are made on behalf of all eligible employees even if they choose not to contribute to the 401(k) plan \\n \\n \\n \\n2.5 Vesting \\n\\t2.5.1 \\tOverview  \\nVesting refers to the ownership in all or a portion of the company’s matching contributions or discretionary contributions and the earnings on these contributions. A participant is always 100% vested in employee and rollover contributions and the earnings on those contributions. Employer contributions such as matching or discretionary contributions may be subject to a vesting schedule. \\n\\t2.5.2 \\tVesting Credit  \\nA participant gains ownership of employer contributions and the earnings associated with those contributions according to a schedule referred to as Vesting Schedule, Under ERISA, an employer generally must give credit for a year of vesting for any year in which the employee worked 1,000 hours or more. \\nEmployers may also determine vesting based on elapsed time. Elapsed time does not count hours. An employee receives vesting credit after completing a specific length of service.  \\nERISA provides minimum standards for two types of vesting schedules: cliff and graded. \\nHowever, 401(k) plans may choose to be more generous than the ERISA requirements.  \\nCliff Vesting Schedule \\nIn a cliff vesting schedule, the participant becomes fully vested in the employer contributions and associated earnings after a certain period of time. No partial vesting occurs. For employer contributions for plan years beginning n 2002, a participant must be fully vested after completing three years of vesting service. \\n \\nERISA MINIMUM - CLIFF SCHEDULE \\nYears of Service  \\tVesting %  \\nLess than 3 years  \\t0%  \\n3 years or more  \\t100%  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nGraded Vesting Schedule  \\nIn a graded vesting schedule, the participant becomes vested in the employer contributions and associated earnings gradually over a period of time. For plan years beginning in 2002, ERISA requires that a participant must be fully vested after six years of vesting service. The participant must be at least 20% vested after two years, 40% after three years, 60% after four years, 80% vested after five years of vesting service, and 100% after six years of vesting service.  \\nA plan may be more generous and offer a two-year cliff, for example. \\n\\nERISA MINIMUM - GRADED SCHEDULE  \\nYears of Service  \\tVesting %  \\nLess than 2 years  \\t0%  \\n2 years  \\t20%  \\n3 years  \\t40%  \\n4 years  \\t60%  \\n5 years  \\t80%  \\n6 years  \\t100%  \\n\\n \\nA plan may be more generous and offer a four-year graded schedule, for example, where the participant is fully vested after four years of vesting service. \\n \\n \\n2.6 Forfeitures \\nIf a participant leaves the company before being fully vested, the participant may forfeit all or a portion of the employer contributions and associated earnings. The Exclusive Benefit Rule states that forfeited amounts cannot be returned to the employer, but must be used for the plan‟s participants. The employer can either apply these forfeited amounts to reduce future employer contributions or reallocate forfeitures among the remaining plan participants.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.7 Account Activity  \\nPlan representatives and administrators have the ability to routinely process transactions for participants. They have access to each participant‟s account information to process requisitions to:  \\nChange contribution rates;  \\nChange future investment directions;  \\nMove existing balances from one fund to another; and   Respond to information requests.  \\nThese transactions are processed based on the plan‟s valuation cycle. Participants generally complete these types of transactions through an automated touch-tone phone system or a web site and then receive a confirmation statement. Participants may also contact a plan representative to assist them with the transaction.  \\nContribution Rate Changes  \\nWhen participants first enroll in a 401(k) plan, they must elect the amount they want to contribute to the plan. This amount is expressed as a percentage of eligible compensation. If the 40 1(k) plan permits before-tax and after-tax contributions, the participant elects how much will be contributed on a before-tax and/or after-tax basis.  \\nAfter the initial enrollment, participants may wish to change the percentage of compensation they contribute throughout the year. The plan may, however, limit the number of times a participant can make a change in any plan year. Contribution rate changes are typically processed. Only one or two times per month-usually based on the participant‟s payroll cycle.  \\nChanges cannot exceed plan limits. For example, a 401(k) plan may permit a NHCE participant to contribute between 1% and 15% of eligible compensation. The plan may restrict HCE participants to contribution elections between 1% and 8% of eligible compensation.  \\nInvestment Direction  \\nAn investment direction election determines where future contributions and loan repayments should be invested. Investment directions generally must be made in increments of 1% and must total 100%. A participant‟s investment strategy may change or the participant may want to respond to market changes, and therefore, redirect where the contributions are invested. The investment direction election has no effect on existing balances in the investment funds. \\nFund Transfers \\nFund transfers move balances directly from one investment fund to another investment fund to another investment fund or funds. The participant determines the percentages to be transferred. Participants may make this election through the automated touch-tone system, web site or plan representative.  \\nFund Reallocations  \\nFund reallocations (sometimes called balance reallocations) require the participant to indicate, in whole percentages, an amount for each of the investment choices. The participant may elect a zero percentage for some of the funds. Theoretically, it is as though the participant takes all the money in all the funds and holds it in her hands. She then has to decide, in whole percentages, where the money is to be invested. The total must equal 100%.  \\n2.8 Loans \\n Overview  \\nIf the plan has a loan provision, participants may borrow money from their 401(k) plan account. A plan loan is an agreement that allows participants to borrow from their account and repay the principal, with interest, back into the account, generally repaid through payroll deductions. If the loan is repaid on schedule, no tax liability is incurred; however, failure to repay will result in default of the loan and tax consequences to the participant.\\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) & Internal Revenue Service (IRS) imposes several plan loan restrictions to ensure that loan provisions are designed in a nondiscriminatory manner with regard to: \\nAvailability; \\nInterest rates; \\nThe security of the loan and  Administrative procedures.  \\nLoan amounts;  \\nThe duration of the loan; and  Taxes. \\nAlthough 401(k) plans are not required to offer loans, an employer may choose to offer one or both of the following loan: \\nGeneral purpose loan (also referred to as a general loan) \\nHome loan (also referred to as a primary residence loan)  \\nERISA imposes restrictions on the maximum duration of a loan. Typically, a general purpose loan must be repaid within 5 years. A home loan may be extended beyond the five years period (that is, 5, 10, 15 or 20 years or other period). If participant is refinancing a home loan, the new loan will need to be paid off within the original term of the loan.   \\n \\nThe IRS restricts maximum loan amounts. If the plan permits, a participant may have more than one loan outstanding. However, the maximum amount a participant may borrow at any one time is $50,000 of his vested account balance (VAB). Under ERISA, the VAB includes outstanding loan balances (OLBs).  \\n \\nThe amount a participant may borrow is determined by using the following formula:  \\nThe lesser of:  \\n1/2 (Vested Account Balance + Outstanding Loan Balance)-Outstanding Loan Balance  or  \\n$50,000 minus the highest Outstanding Loan Balance in the past 12 months  (The highest OLB can come from loans currently outstanding or loans that were  paid in full during the past 12 months.)  \\n \\nFor example, if a plan sets a minimum loan amount of $1 000, the participant‟s vested account balance must be at least $2000 with no outstanding loans. \\n \\nThe plan may restrict a particular type of contribution (for example, employer match) from being borrowed, yet allow those contributions to be included in the account balance recognized in the maximum loan amount calculation.  \\nThe amount available for a participant to borrow is based on the vested value of the account on the day he requests for the loan, since the loan is actually paid from the participant‟s account on the date it is processed. It is likely that the participant‟s vested account balance has changed. However, it is important to note that the 50% rule pertains to the vested account balance at the time of the request, not at the time the loan is processed. \\nLoan money comes from the before-tax money type, which includes:  \\nEmployee before-tax contributions;  \\nEmployer match;  \\nPrevious rollover monies; and  \\nThe earnings from these monies.  \\nIn some cases, after-tax contributions are also included. The plan determines the order of the money types used to provide loan. For example, some plans may require loan amounts to come from rollover money first, then employee before-tax contributions, then employer contributions, and last employee after-tax contributions. \\nLoan Repayments \\nParticipants must repay loans according to the terms agreed to under the plan, but no less frequently than quarterly. Generally, loan repayments are made through payroll deductions each pay period with after tax dollars. Exceptions may occur, however. A participant can be on unpaid leave, for example, and make payments from a personal check or electronic fund transfer, if the plan allows. An amortization schedule shows how the portion of each repayment applies to the outstanding interest and principal. \\nThe money is usually repaid according to the current investment direction elected by the participant and is repaid to its original money type even though it is deducted from the participants paycheck after taxes are taken out. Therefore the investment funds the loan is paid from will often not be the same investment funds to which repayment is made. However the repayment is made into the contribution type the loan money was taken from. \\nLoan Prepayments  \\nPrepayment of loans, in full, is generally permitted at any time. Some plans may permit partial prepayment. Procedure for prepayment varies from plan to plan. \\nDeemed Distribution \\nMost loans are repaid by deductions from the employee‟s paycheck. Generally, when a participant with an outstanding loan goes on unpaid leave, the loan can be repaid manually by check or electronic fund transfer. If an active participant does not make the required payments, the loan will be considered a deemed distribution after a fixed period of time, usually 90 days.  \\nParticipants who have a deemed distribution will receive an IRS Form 1099-R in January of the year following the year in which the deemed distribution occurred. Deemed distributions are not eligible for rollover to a qualified plan or IRA. \\nIf a participant has a loan that is considered to be a deemed distribution, and the loan has not been repaid, he will generally not be allowed to request a new loan until the deemed loan is paid back. As of January 1, 2004, some plans may allow their participants with an unpaid loan considered as a deemed distribution to request a new loan if the participant enters into a payroll withholding agreement or provides the plan with adequate security for the loan. This policy may not apply to all our clients‟ plans. In other words, this policy may vary from client to client. \\nSuspension of loan repayments during an active military leave of absence will NOT cause the loan to be deemed distributed, even if the leave exceeds a year. The loan must be fully repaid by the end of the original term plus the period of the active military service. .  \\nSeparating from Service with an Outstanding Loan Balance \\nIf the participant separates from service with an outstanding loan balance, most employers require that the loan be repaid, in full, within a specified period of time after separation. If the loan is not repaid within the specified time, it is defaulted and reported as a taxable distribution for the year in which it is defaulted. \\nTaxation of Defaulted Loans \\nFailure to repay a loan after separating from service, according to the terms of the plan results in default of the loan. If the loan is defaulted, the outstanding loan balance is considered a taxable distribution and is thus subject to federal (and state, if applicable) income tax withholding for the year of the distribution. The participant receives an IRS Form 1099-R for the outstanding loan balance in January following the year of default. If the participant defaults on the loan after separating from service, the outstanding loan balance is reported as taxable income. \\n \\n \\n2.9 Withdrawal \\nAlthough the primary purpose of a 401(k) plan is to help employees save for retirement, many plans allow participants to withdraw money from their 401(k) plan (MS accounts while actively employed. Employers are not required to make withdrawals from 401(k) plans available to their participants. Therefore, the plans of different employers are structured differently, with some being more restrictive in their withdrawal provisions than others. If in-service withdrawals are permitted from the plan, the money withdrawn from the account cannot be paid back and is subject to taxation if not rolled over. \\nActively employed participants can make these three main types of withdrawals from their plan accounts: \\n Regular or ordinary withdrawal;   Hardship withdrawal; and   Age 59½ withdrawal.  \\nEach type of withdrawal has specific Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and plan restrictions controlling the money types available for withdrawal and the order of their withdrawal. \\n \\n\\t2.9.1 \\tTaxation of In-Service Withdrawals \\nUnder current federal tax law, participants are not required to pay federal, and in most cases, state and local income tax on contributions and their earnings in a 401(k) plan as long as they remain in the plan. Generally, whenever money is withdrawn or distributed from a 401(k) plan it becomes subject to taxation. Taxation varies depending on the money type withdrawn and the reason for the withdrawal in general \\nThe withdrawal is subject to a 20% mandatory federal income tax withholding, if not rolled over. The amount of the mandatory withholding may be more or less than the amount the participant owes in federal income tax. A participants actual tax liability for the withdrawal will depend on the participants own tax situation for example exemptions household income deductions etc Withholding for state taxes may also be required. \\n \\nAmounts obtained from in-service withdrawals may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if the participant is under age 59 ½. The plan does not withhold for the 10% penalty tax at the time of distribution; participants pay the penalty when they file their taxes.  \\n \\nAn IRS Form 1099-R is mailed to the participant in January of the year following the year in which the withdrawal is taken. For example, for a withdrawal taken in March of 2003, the participant receives a 1099-R in January 2004. This form shows the total amount of the withdrawal, the amount subject to tax, and the amount of federal and state tax withheld and forwarded to the IRS and state agencies. \\n \\n\\t2.9.2 \\tRegular Withdrawal  \\n Overview \\nA regular or ordinary withdrawal has the same basic characteristics of all in- service withdrawals: \\nThey are generally available only to actively employed participants;  \\nThe plan sponsor chooses the money or contribution types available; and establishes a withdrawal hierarchy.  \\n Contribution Types Available \\nThe types of contributions and associated earnings available for a regular withdrawal are chosen by the plan sponsor and may include:  \\nAfter-tax;  \\nRollover; and \\nEmployer contributions.  \\nRegular withdrawals do not include participant before-tax contributions or the associated earnings. ESOP, PAYSOP and TRASOP money is usually available for in-service withdrawals. \\n \\n \\n\\t2.9.3 \\tHardship Withdrawal \\nOverview  \\nParticipants with immediate and heavy financial need and no reasonable access to money from elsewhere can withdraw certain contributions from their 401(k) plans. The plan administrator determines whether the participant fulfills Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and plan-imposed hardship withdrawal requirements. He reviews the withdrawal request and associated documents and makes the determination based either on the “facts and circumstances” of each case or adoption of the Internal Revenue Code “safe harbor” guidelines or a combination of both.  \\nIRS Requirements \\nIRS regulations provide a narrow definition of hardship: The hardship must be caused by the immediate and heavy financial needs of the participant for which other resources are not reasonably available.  \\nTo qualify for a hardship withdrawal, the participant‟s request must pass a two-part test.  \\nthe qualifying need exists; and.  \\nno other resources are reasonably available to meet the need.  \\n       To determine the “existence of need” employers may use one of two methods:  \\nlRS Safe Harbors \\nFacts and Circumstances  \\n \\n\\t2.9.4 \\tAge 59 ½ Withdrawal \\nOverview  \\nActive participants age 59 ½ and older may take in-service withdrawals from their 401(k) plans. At age 59 ½, 401(k) plan participants may have access to more of their account. \\nContribution Types Available \\nIf the 401(k) plan allows, the participant may withdraw vested amounts from all types of contributions within individual plan limits. All participant contributions and associated earnings, including before tax monies, are made available for withdrawal at age 59 ½ Depending on plan provisions, employer contributions may be restricted. \\n \\n \\n2.10 Rollover \\nIn-Bound Rollovers  \\nEmployees may also contribute to a 401(k) plan by rolling over contributions. In-bound rollovers from another qualified plan or conduit IRA. Employees who have contributions in another qualified plan, usually from another employer, may be allowed to roll over these contributions to the current employer‟s plan to continue deferring the contributions from taxes. Beginning with plan years after December 31, 2001, taxable money in an IRA can be rolled to a 401(k) plan without using a conduit IRA.  \\n \\nIn-bound rollovers into a qualified plan may only contain taxable contributions and earnings. Beginning in 2002, after-tax contributions can be rolled over. Prior to 2002, after-tax contributions could not be rolled over, though the earnings on after-tax contributions were eligible for rollover since they had never been taxed. If a qualified plan accepts rollover of after-tax contributions, it must agree to account for the after-tax contributions separately.  \\n \\n \\n In-Bound Rollover Procedures  \\nThere are no regulations stating that employers must accept in-bound rollover contributions into their qualified plans. As a result, employers may or may not allow in-bound rollovers. Plans are required, however, to offer rollovers-out to other plans.  \\nIf rollovers-in are permitted in the plan, the following general procedures may apply: \\nEmployers may require employees to be able to participate in the 401(k) plan before rollovers-in will be accepted.  \\nEmployees may need to complete an in-bound rollover-in request form. The form will ask for the desired investment direction for the amount rolled over. \\nEmployees must attach the check from the previous plan or IRA.  \\nEmployees may need to provide documentation verifying that the in-bound rollover came from a qualified plan or a conduit IRA. Examples of this documentation include: letter of determination or a distribution statement.  \\n \\nOut - Bound Rollovers  \\nAt the time of distribution, the participant has the option to continue to defer taxation by rolling over all or a portion of the eligible account balance into an Individual Retirement Account or another qualified plan A direct rollover allows the participant to move the eligible account balance directly from one qualified plan to another or to an IRA Eligible account balances rolled into an IRA can subsequently be rolled into a qualified plan if it has been held in a conduit IRA (def An IRA that contains only taxable money from a qualified employer retirement plan It is not commingled with other money). \\n \\nBeginning in 2002 taxable money in an IRA can be rolled to a 401(k) plan without being held in a conduit IRA .Amounts that are eligible to be rolled over include employee before tax contributions and earnings, employer contributions and earnings, rollovers and associated earnings and aftertax contributions and associated earnings. Because of EGTRRA, after tax contributions are now eligible for a rollover. If the entire eligible account balance is rolled over, there are no tax consequences. The account balance is simply moving from one tax-deferred vehicle to another. \\n \\nIf at the time of distribution, participants elect to have their account balance paid directly to them, 20% of the taxable distribution will be withheld for federal income tax withholding. Withholding for state taxes may be required. A rollover option still exists however. Participants may choose to open their own IRA or make a rollover contribution to their new employer‟s qualified plan within60 days of the distribution. Participants may add their own money to make up all or a portion of the entire 20% that was withheld.  \\n \\nThe withholding tax paid to the IRS will be combined with all other taxes paid by the participant for the year. Participants may be due a refund when they file their tax return at year-end. \\n \\n \\n2.11 Distribution \\n Overview  \\nShareholders may take final distributions, upon termination, from a stock fund in the form of shares or cash. In certain types of plans, the employer may be required to offer the distribution in the form of shares Upon distribution it is up to the participant to decide whether to take the shares or receive the value of the shares as cash instead. When a participant chooses a share distribution, fractional shares in a participant‟s account are paid in cash. \\nFor example, a participant elects to take a distribution in shares. At the time of the distribution, she has a dollar value in her account of $1,520. The shares are valued at $50 a share. She would receive 30 shares of stock (30 X $50 = $1,500) and $20 in cash. \\n Participants qualify for final distribution of their vested account balances when they: \\nSeparate from service (retirement or otherwise);  \\nQualify as disabled under the specific plan guidelines;  \\nDie, in which case the account balance can be distributed to their designated beneficiary. \\nFinal distributions can be paid in several ways. Some forms of payment are required while others are not. Forms of payment include:  \\nA lump sum payment;  \\nDeferred payment; \\nInstallments; and \\nAn annuity, although these are rare.  \\nWhen a participant dies, the beneficiary is entitled to payment of the account balance. If the participant is married at the time of death, the beneficiary would automatically be the spouse. If the spouse has signed a valid consent/waiver, the participant may name someone else as beneficiary to receive amounts in the 401(k) plan after the participant‟s death. Spousal beneficiaries have the option to defer distribution until the participant would have been 70Y2. Non-spousal beneficiaries must receive a distribution no later than five years after the participant‟s death. The employer decides which payment options, besides those legally required, are offered by the plan. \\n\\t2.11.1 \\tFinal Distribution Requirements \\nWhen a participant retires, leaves the company, or becomes disabled the participant can elect to: \\nReceive a distribution, or \\nLeave the money in the plan until a later date (defer the payment)  provided the vested account balance is greater than the plan‟s cash out  level (see below). \\nIf the participant leaves the account balance in the plan:  \\nTaxes will continue to be deferred until the participant receives the  money.  \\nThe balance of the account that remains in the plan will share in gains  or losses of the investment funds.  \\nInvestment changes may be made according to the rules of the  individual plan.  \\nThe participant can request a final distribution at any time in the future.  \\nThe forms of payment for final distribution must include a lump sum payment option; however, the plan sponsor does have some discretion. For example, the plan sponsor may or may not offer installment and/or annuity payments.  \\n \\nCash out Amounts \\nWhen participants request a final distribution, they receive a distribution package, which explains payment options as well as the rollover option. For administrative convenience, ERISA permits 401(k) plan balances at or below a certain level, referred to as the cash out amount, to be paid out after separation from service of employment without the participant‟s consent. The current threshold is a vested account balance of $5,000 or less. Plan sponsors have the choice to implement this option.  \\nIf the vested account balance is greater than $5,000, IRC regulations require the participant‟s consent before making a lump sum distribution. Without the participant‟s consent, the distribution will be deferred.  \\nIf the vested account balance is $5,000 or less, then the lump sum payment may be distributed without the participant‟s consent. The participant must be given an opportunity to elect a direct rollover of the eligible account balance.  \\nPayment Options  \\nIf participants choose to receive a distribution from the plan, they may be able to choose from various payment options, which may include:  \\nLump sum paid to the participant - the participant‟s vested account balance is distributed to the participant. The plan administrator automatically deducts the mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding from the distribution. The distribution may also be subject to the 10% penalty tax if the participant is under the age of 59 ½ and not otherwise exempt. Withholding for state taxes may also be required. \\n \\nLump sum rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA - the participant‟s vested account balance is distributed to the qualified plan or IRA. There is no federal income tax withholding. \\nInstallment - a specific number of payments of approximately equal value. The payment amount is calculated based on the number of payments requested. An example of an installment payment option would be a provision, which allows participants to elect up to 20 annual installments. Installment payments of ten years or less are eligible to be rolled over.  \\nAnnuity - a series of regular payments, guaranteed to continue for a specific time, usually the participant‟s lifetime. The payment amount is calculated based on the life expectancy of the participant or the participant and the joint beneficiary (using IRS actuarial tables). Annuities are rare in 401(k) plans.  \\n \\nIf the participant defers payment, the participant may come back at any time and request a distribution. The ability of a participant to leave money in the 401(k) plan account depends on whether it is above the cash out level ($5,000). If the balance of the account is above the cash out level, a participant cannot be forced to take a distribution. Ievel, a participant cannot be forced to take a distribution.  \\n Taxation of Final Distributions \\nAs with withdrawals, final distributions are subject to the mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding, and the 10% penalty tax if the participant is under age 59¼ and not otherwise exempt, unless the distribution is directly rolled over Withholding of state taxes may also be required.  \\nThe 10% penalty tax does not apply if the final distribution is made \\nAfter age 59 ½;  \\nBecause of separation from service at or after age 55 (separation includes leaving the company for any reason or retirement);  \\nPayable in the form of periodic payment;  \\nOn account of a QDRO; or \\nFor certain medical expenses (those that are deductible for income tax purpose; unreimbursed medical expenses must exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. \\n\\t2.11.2 \\tMinimum Required Distribution  \\nOverview  \\nAge 70 ½ minimum required distributions, more commonly known as, Minimum Required Distributions (MRDs), mandate certain 401(k) plan participants receive certain minimum payment from their account balances beginning at age 70 ½. MRDs apply to all qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans and pension plans. MRDs also apply to IRAs. \\nRequirements \\nThe IRC requires participants to begin receiving MRDs from a 401(k) plan no later than April 1 following the year in which the participant reaches age 70 ½. \\nMRDs are paid annually. The first payment must begin by April 1 of the year following the year in which the participant turns 70 ½ Subsequent distributions must be paid by December 31 of each year. Consequently, there may be two payments received in the first year.  \\nIf the participant fails to receive an annual minimum required distribution during the required time frame, the individual may incur a tax penalty equal to 50% of the amount that should have been distributed.  \\nBeginning in 1997, active participants in 401(k) plans who are over age 70 ½ can delay commencement of MRDs until the later of retirement or separation from service. \\nNote, this does not apply to IRA participants or 401(k) plan participants who own 5% or more of the company. The IRS requires them to begin receiving MRDs at age 70 ½.  \\nThe MRD calculation is based on the participant‟s life expectancy, or the joint life expectancies of the participant and designated beneficiary based on actuarial tables set forth by the IRS. \\n Taxation of 70 ½ Minimum Required Distributions \\nThe mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding does not apply to MRDs. Instead, the recipient is required to make a federal income tax withholding election on IRS Form W-4P. In some cases, if the participant fails to make a withholding election before the annual payment is made, the plan withholds federal income tax based on a default election. An MRD is not eligible for rollover. Participants can no longer defer paying taxes on this money once the MRD has been paid to them. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\"}]}', NULL, '{\"plan_text_in_markdown_format\":\"1. **Single Correct Questions**: 1 EASY, 1 MEDIUM, 1 DIFFICULT\\n2. **Multiple Correct Questions**: 1 EASY, 1 MEDIUM\\n3. **Short Answer Questions**: 1 EASY\\n4. **Fill Up Blanks**: 1 MEDIUM\\n5. **Match the Following**: 1 DIFFICULT\",\"assessment_title\":\"Retirement Induction Assessment\",\"assessment_description\":\"This assessment evaluates understanding of retirement and financial services, focusing on various retirement plans, eligibility, contributions, and distribution mechanisms.\",\"single_correct_questions\":[{\"number\":\"1/5\",\"question\":\"What is the primary difference between a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan?\",\"choices\":[\"Defined benefit plan has a definite benefit formula, defined contribution plan does not\",\"Defined contribution plan guarantees a fixed return, defined benefit plan does not\",\"Defined benefit plan is more flexible, defined contribution plan is less flexible\",\"Defined contribution plan is only for highly compensated employees\"],\"correct_answer_text\":\"Defined benefit plan has a definite benefit formula, defined contribution plan does not\",\"explanation\":\"In defined benefit plans, the benefit is calculated based on a formula, whereas in defined contribution plans, the final benefit depends on contributions and investment returns.\",\"level\":\"EASY\"},{\"number\":\"2/5\",\"question\":\"Which of the following is NOT a type of defined contribution plan?\",\"choices\":[\"401(k) plan\",\"Profit sharing plan\",\"Thrift plan\",\"Pension plan\"],\"correct_answer_text\":\"Pension plan\",\"explanation\":\"A pension plan is a type of defined benefit plan, not a defined contribution plan.\",\"level\":\"MEDIUM\"},{\"number\":\"3/5\",\"question\":\"What is required to ensure non-discrimination in qualified plans under ERISA?\",\"choices\":[\"Plans must include all employees regardless of compensation\",\"Plans may not favor highly compensated employees\",\"Plans must offer the same contributions to all employees\",\"Plans must exclude part-time employees\"],\"correct_answer_text\":\"Plans may not favor highly compensated employees\",\"explanation\":\"ERISA guidelines ensure that no particular group, such as highly compensated employees, is favored in qualified plans.\",\"level\":\"DIFFICULT\"}],\"multiple_correct_questions\":[{\"number\":\"4/5\",\"question\":\"Under which conditions can employees participate in a 401(k) plan?\",\"choices\":[\"Employee must be over 21 years old\",\"Employee must have completed one year of service\",\"Employee must work full-time\",\"Employee must be a permanent employee\"],\"correct_answer_text_list\":[\"Employee must be over 21 years old\",\"Employee must have completed one year of service\"],\"explanation\":\"Eligibility is often based on age and service, allowing participation once employees are over 21 and have completed a year of service.\",\"level\":\"EASY\"},{\"number\":\"5/5\",\"question\":\"What are the key features of a 401(k) plan?\",\"choices\":[\"Allows employee contributions\",\"Provides tax-deferred growth\",\"Employer contributions are mandatory\",\"Requires vesting schedule for all contributions\"],\"correct_answer_text_list\":[\"Allows employee contributions\",\"Provides tax-deferred growth\"],\"explanation\":\"401(k) plans allow employees to contribute and grow their retirement savings tax-deferred.
